        activity. Teams of 3-10 people, with or without disabilities,

      It may be called an escape room but we don't lock you in. You can leave at
      any time. We design around fun themes rather than stressful ones. That is just part of what makes our escape room accessible!  The puzzles vary in difficulty and everyone, regardless of disability, can participate. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to reach the most people, our escape rooms are portable and
      designed for easy setup in hotel and conference rooms. <Branding

        A few years ago, over lunch, Matt Ater and Rachael Bradley Montgomery
        joked about creating an accessible escape room. Why? Because Matt, who
        is blind, had attended his daughter's birthday party at an escape room
        and wasn't able to participate â€“ at all! Fast forward a year and we were
        still talking about it. We realized how few individuals with
        disabilities were able to enjoy this fun activity and so decided to go
        ahead and build one. We met with Escape Room Loco in Leesburg, VA to
        learn more. Then along with a team of volunteers from Accessible
        Community, MITRE, and Vispero we built our first escape room. It had an
        espionage theme and while it wasn't perfect, everyone could participate
        in at least one puzzle, usually more. A team of all blind individuals
        who helped pilot test it had the best score of everyone!
