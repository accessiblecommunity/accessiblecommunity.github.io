      It may be called an escape room but we don't lock you in. You can leave at
      any time. We design around fun themes rather than stressful ones. That is
      just part of what makes our escape room accessible! The puzzles vary in
      difficulty and everyone, regardless of disability, can participate.

          A few years ago, over lunch, Matt Ater and Rachael Bradley Montgomery
          joked about creating an accessible escape room. Why? Because Matt, who
          is blind, had attended his daughter's birthday party at an escape room
          and wasn't able to participate â€“ at all! Fast forward a year and we
          were still talking about it. We realized how few individuals with
          disabilities were able to enjoy this fun activity and so decided to go
          ahead and build one. We met with Escape Room Loco in Leesburg, VA to
          learn more. Then along with a team of volunteers from Accessible
          Community, MITRE, and Vispero we built our first escape room. It had an
          espionage theme and while it wasn't perfect, everyone could participate
          in at least one puzzle, usually more. A team of all blind individuals
          who helped pilot test it had the best score of everyone!

    <p class="lead">
      If you would like to create an accessible escape room for your business or
      organization, here are some tips to get started.
    </p>
    <ul class="bullets">
      <li>
        Pick a theme that doesn't cause anxiety. Don't lock people in or create
        panic intentionally. Instead, create challenging puzzles in a fun
        atmosphere.
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't design puzzles to rely on a single sense. Provide hints using both
        sound and sight, preferably sound, sight and touch.
      </li>
      <li>Offer an untimed option to participants who need it.</li>
      <li>Provide accommodations when requested.</li>
      <li>
        Create a set of puzzles so that everyone can engage with at least one.
        This means at least one puzzle should take voice input.
      </li>
