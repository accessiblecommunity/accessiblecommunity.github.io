    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      A few years ago, over lunch, Matt Ater and Rachael Bradley Montgomery joked about creating an accessible escape room. Why? Because Matt, who is blind, had attended his daughter's birthday party at an escape room and wasn't able to participate â€“ at all! Fast forward a year and we were still talking about it. We realized how few individuals with disabilities were able to enjoy this fun activity and so decided to go ahead and build one. We met with Escape Room Loco in Leesburg, VA to learn more. Then along with a team of volunteers from Accessible Community, MITRE, and Vispero we built our first escape room. It had an espionage theme and while it wasn't perfect everyone could participate in at least one puzzle, usually more. A team of all blind individuals who helped pilot test it had the best score of everyone!
