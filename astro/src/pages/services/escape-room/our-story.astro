            A few years ago, over lunch, Matt Ater and Rachael Bradley Montgomery
            joked about creating an accessible escape room. Why? Because Matt, who
            is blind, had attended his daughter's birthday party at an escape room
            and wasn't able to participate â€“ at all! Fast forward a year and we were
            still talking about it. We realized how few individuals with
            disabilities were able to enjoy this fun activity and so decided to go
            ahead and build one. We met with Escape Room Loco in Leesburg, VA to
            learn more. Then along with a team of volunteers from <a href="/">Accessible
            Community</a>, <ExternalLink inline href="https://www.mitre.org/"
            >MITRE</ExternalLink>, and <ExternalLink inline href="https://vispero.com/"
            >Vispero</ExternalLink>, we built our first escape room. It had an
            espionage theme and while it wasn't perfect, everyone could participate
            in at least one puzzle, usually more. A team of all blind individuals
            who helped pilot test it had the best score of everyone!

            If you would like to create an accessible escape room for your
            business or organization, here are some tips to get started.</p
          >
          <ul>
            <li
              >Pick a theme that doesn't cause anxiety. Don't lock people in or
              create panic intentionally. Instead, create challenging puzzles in a
              fun atmosphere.</li
            >
            <li
              >Don't design puzzles to rely on a single sense. Provide hints using
              both sound and sight, preferably sound, sight and touch.</li
            >
            <li>Offer an untimed option to participants who need it.</li>
            <li>Provide accommodations when requested.</li>
            <li
              >Create a set of puzzles so that everyone can engage with at least
              one. This means at least one puzzle should take voice input.</li
            >
