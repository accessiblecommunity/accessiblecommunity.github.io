      coordinates mutua11y's accessibility mentoring program. This program
      brings together emerging accessibility professionals with experts in the
      field. Mentors and protégés meet for an hour once or twice a month for
      3-12 months. The activities include discussion prompts and an optional
      opportunity to assess a small organizations website and discuss the
      results.
    </p>

    <p>The goals for our mentoring program include:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Supplementing limited educational opportunities in accessibility and
        universal design by providing hands on experience.
      </li>
      <li>
        Helping small businesses and community organizations become more
        inclusive of people with diverse abilities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Building a workforce of educated professionals by engaging and inspiring
        them about creating a more inclusive world.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      We match protégés with mentors as mentors become available. We do our best
      to prioritize requests who have been waiting for a mentor for a while but
      we also strive for a good match in skills and location.
    </p>

    <p>
      We provide activities and discussion prompts to help make the mentoring as
      productive and easy as possible. Some pairs choose to use these and others
      choose to follow their own discussion topics.
    </p>

    <p>
      When enrolled in mutua11y's accessibility mentoring program, we will
      provide opportunities to join activities like certification study groups,
      interview workshops and more so even when protégés are not matched
      immediately they will have a chance to learn.
    </p>
