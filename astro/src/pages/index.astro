    <p class="lead">One in every three households includes someone who has a disability. These individuals and families often struggle to find places in their community where they can successfully shop, eat, and participate in community life.</p>
    <ul class="lead">
      <li><strong>Communities matter</strong>. Being a part of a local community is important.</li>
      <li>Local communities are made up of <strong>people</strong> and <strong>small organizations</strong>.</li>
      <li>A majority of small organizations do not have the knowledge or resources to effectively reach people with disabilities.</li>
      <li>People with disabilities want to be a part of their community and part of the solution in removing barriers to that community.</li>
      <li>We can <strong>incentivize</strong> those people and organizations we partner with by creating scenarios where <strong>all parties win</strong>.</li>
