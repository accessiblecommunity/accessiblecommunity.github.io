 <Section theme="body-tertiary">
  <p class="display-6">Date Last Updated: <time datetime="2023-05-05">5 May 2023</time></p>
  <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold">Purpose</h2>
  <p class="display-6">Accessible Community is led and staffed by volunteers. Succeeding at our mission to establish and nurture disability-inclusive communities depends on our staff's  time, knowledge, dedication, and diversity.  As such, we are all committed to creating a welcoming environment where discrimination and harassment are not tolerated and individual rights are protected.</p>
  <p class="display-6">The purpose of this code of conduct is to set clear expectations of behavior between staff in Accessible Community in order to create a positive experience for all participants. This code applies to all leadership, staff, board of directors, and interns.</p>
  <p class="display-6">This code refers to several more detailed policies but key points are included here to promote adoption and understanding.</p>
  <h2 class="display-4 fw-bold">Principles</h2>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Support the Mission</h3>
  <p class="display-6">I believe in and support Accessible Community's mission to establish and nurture disability-inclusive communities by helping:</p>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>small-to-medium size organizations become accessible,</li>
   <li>people with disabilities find accessible and disability-support organizations,</li>
   <li>emerging accessibility professionals grow their experience and connections, and</li>
   <li>senior accessibility experts and organization leaders to collaborate and share ideas.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Mutual Respect and Caring</h3>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will respect each individual's unique experiences, needs, and perspective.</li>
   <li>I will do my best to be transparent and honest; to communicate my needs and keep the best interest of others in mind.</li>
   <li>I will try to treat others as I wish to be treated.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Value Diversity</h3>
  <p class="display-6">Our staff and participants come from all over the world. As a community, we embody different languages, cultures, religions, races, genders and gender identities, disabilities, backgrounds and experiences. I have read and agree to follow the <a href="/non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</a>.</p>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will respect the diverse nature of our community.</li>
   <li>I will support an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment for leadership, staff, board of directors, and interns.</li>
   <li>I will strive to value our community's diversity as it improves the quality of our products and expands our impact.</li>
   <li>I will approach differences with kindness and curiosity.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Foster Safe Environment</h3>
  <p class="display-6">I have read and agree to follow the <a href="/harrassment-policy">Harassment Policy</a>. All leadership, staff, and program participants are responsible for fostering a safe environment, free of harassment. No one should be afraid for their physical or mental health while volunteering at Accessible Community. I agree that:</p>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will strive to foster a safe working environment where everyone is accepted and allowed to be themselves.</li>
   <li>I understand that a safe working environment is not free of criticism or conflict, but I will handle criticism and conflict with respect.</li>
   <li>I will strive to set an example of appropriate behavior.</li>
   <li>I will report situations of harassment immediately on becoming aware of them, whether or not there has been a complaint.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Assumption of Best Intent</h3>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will start with the assumption that everyone involved in this program has my best interest and the needs of the disability community at heart.</li>
   <li>When misunderstandings or conflicts occur that do not involve harassment, discrimination or other unsafe situations:
    <ul>
     <li>I will seek to talk about misunderstandings or conflicts when they arise with the people involved.</li>
     <li>I will seek outside opinions only after I have tried to resolve the problem with those involved.</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Confidentiality and Friendly Professionalism</h3>
  <p class="display-6">Accessible Community strives to create a respectful space where people can converse without fear of it being shared outside the community of volunteers.</p>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will be kind and friendly, while setting and respecting personal and professional boundaries and behaviors.</li>
   <li>I will respect the confidentiality of conversations and personal information.</li>
   <li>I will ask for permission when I want to share any information more widely.</li>
   <li>I will not make statements for Accessible Community unless it is part of my volunteer work.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Respect for Intellectual Property</h3>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will respect the intellectual property of others.</li>
   <li>I will make reasonable efforts to protect the intellectual property of all participants and Accessible Community.</li>
   <li>If I wish to use the materials from Accessible Community that are not under creative commons license, I will contact director@accessiblecommunity.org to request permission.</li>
   <li>If I wish to use the materials from other individuals or organizations, I will research the copyright, request permission from that individual or organization when appropriate, and cite the work appropriately.</li>
   <li>I will ask when I am unsure about intellectual property.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Use Technology Responsibly</h3>
  <p class="display-6">I have read through and agree to follow the <a href="/technology-policy">Technology Policy</a>. I agree that:</p>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I am responsible for my account.</li>
   <li>I will not share my personal USER ID and/or password with another person.</li>
   <li>I will log off when I'm not using my account(s).</li>
   <li>I am responsible for all information accessed and all changes made using my personal USER ID.</li>
   <li>I will safeguard personally identifiable information in this system.</li>
   <li>I will not disclose passwords and other administrative information for any shared administrative accounts to which I am granted access.</li>

   <li>I will not access, damage, alter, transfer, disrupt or facilitate the disruption of or copy any data, software or any other part of Accessible Community's systems.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 class="display-5 fw-bold">Reporting and Outreach for Assistance</h3>
  <ul class="display-6">
   <li>I will reach out to the Executive Director at director@accessiblecommunity.org if I encounter difficulties.</li>
