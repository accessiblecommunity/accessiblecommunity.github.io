## Foundations on Artificial Intelligence and Disabilities

On July 9th, the [U.S. Access Board](http://www.access-board.gov/) (USAB) hosted the first in a series of public meetings to discuss and hear perspectives from both sides of the Artificial Intelligence(AI) and Disabilities conversation. AI practitioners and members of the disabled community are invited to engage with each other and the U.S. Government during [hearings to be held in August 2024](https://www.access-board.gov/news/2024/07/09/u-s-access-board-holds-hearings-on-artificial-intelligence-ai-for-disability-community-and-ai-practitioners/).


The following slide from the USAB's July information session, [Developing AI Equity, Access & Inclusion for All Series Session 1: A Foundation on Artificial Intelligence & Disability](https://usa-accessboard.app.box.com/s/aovk8v7a0xe1peb5y02jpe1hbb0e7dj4), outlines the goals of the hearings. These come as a result of the recent [Presidential Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) (EO) on “safe, secure, and trustworthy AI”:

### Access Board EO Tasks

1. Soliciting public participation and conducting community engagement
2. Issuing technical assistance and recommendations on the risks and benefits of AI, including use of biometrics as a data input
3. Providing people with disabilities access to information and communication technology and transportation services

It was a good, well-paced session. The content, though a bit basic, defined a few key terms and touched on some of the most important key points. I liked the breakdown of three types of AI: Machine Learning, Predictive AI, and Generative AI. The latter of which has exploded in the last couple of years, somewhat eclipsing the other types and causing people to forget that AI has been around for decades in some domains, like healthcare, hiring, and surveillance.

I thought they did a decent job of highlighting both the importance of AI in the lives of people with disabilities, and the challenges or potential dangers of AI to people with disabilities. Today, many peoples' lives are improved through the use of assistive tech, medical notifications, and biometrics. Smart devices for mobility, like wheelchairs with sensors, and adaptive smart home solutions, like Alexa, can be hugely beneficial to people with disabilities. However, all these AI improvements come with increased risks to data privacy and disability discrimination, due to exclusion and/or misrepresentation in the “training data” or “biased” algorithms.

I appreciated that they called out “Multiple Marginalization” when it came to AI uses in healthcare. Though, this is not the only field that being a member of more than one marginalized community could have a negative impact.

The USAB provided a few nice accommodations for the session, like access to the slides, transcript, and sign-language translators. I especially loved that those who spoke on behalf of their organizations during the call introduced themselves with a visual description as well as the usual “why am I here” intro. It was like live-action alt-text. This also included the people providing sign-language support. I'm not sure if it was accidental, but a female signed for the female speakers and a male signed for the male speaker.

All in all, the first session did its dual job of laying the foundations for the hearings to come and showing that the U.S. Gov't is talking about the topic of AI and Disabilities.

## The Memo of Understanding on AI

These hearings stem from the [Memorandum of Understanding(MOU) on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.access-board.gov/ai-mou/), released in May 2024 by the U.S. Access Board, in partnership with the [American Association of People with Disabilities](https://www.aapd.com/) (AAPD) and the [Center for Democracy & Technology](http://wehttps/cdt.org/area-of-focus/privacy-data/disability-rights) (CDT). 

The memo, or MOU, covers the purpose and methods these organizations are employing to address this topic and why they are holding hearings. This is not a plan yet, but a plan to plan. The three orgs
> agree to work together to help ensure that people with disabilities benefit from AI while being protected from its risks. Areas of focus will include biometric discrimination, surveillance, maintenance of data privacy, and algorithmic governance and fairness.

It's notable that the memo is active for three (3) years, but doesn't yet have provisions for when it expires. It reads a bit like a playbook, but is not long.
