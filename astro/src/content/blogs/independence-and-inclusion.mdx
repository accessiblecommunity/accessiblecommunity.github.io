Digital accessibility is personal and crucial for me. It is not about following legal requirements; it's about creating a space for everyone. Everyone should share their stories. This is important in a world that often overlooks them. As a quadriplegic woman, I rely on my phone and computer for independence. My website, [Esther's Walking Journey](https://estherswalkingjourney.co/the-necessity-of-technology-access/), shares my views on access. My commitment to self-reliance is strong. These tools help, even if tasks take longer.

I'm Esther Klang. I'm 30 years old. I live with quadriplegia, shallow breathing, vocal cord paralysis, and a tracheostomy. I've faced these challenges for 19 years since doctors removed a brain tumor when I was 10. This history has led to a speech disability. I use AAC (Augmentative and Alternative Communication) and AT (Assistive Technology) to help me communicate. Today, I want to focus on digital accessibility.

Digital accessibility is essential for my success. It means making digital content easy to see, understand, and use. This ensures that everyone can access online information and services. This is especially important for those who use assistive technologies.

I control digital interfaces without using my hands. I depend on [Sesame Enable](https://www.sesame-enable.com/), a head-tracking software, for my phone and computer. I also use [Augmental's MouthPad](https://www.augmental.tech/) and [Voiceitt](https://www.voiceitt.com/), a speech-to-text app for people with nonstandard speech. Typing means entering one letter at a time. I use an on-screen keyboard that I control with my head movements. I use tools like the app Speech Assistant and ElevenLabs for verbal output.

I often face obstacles that hinder my phone and computer use. Here are some barriers I encounter:

-   Password Authentication: I find it hard to enter passwords correctly without a "show password" button present. I often get locked out of the website and lose access to essential resources.
-   Gesture-Dependent Actions: I need to drag or swipe my cursor for many important tasks. This is hard for me. If there is no alternative input method, I am unable to perform these tasks and must request assistance from someone else.
-   Inadequate Target Sizes: Small buttons and links create challenges for precise interaction with head-tracking software.
-   Inflexible Time Limits: When sessions expire suddenly, there are no options to extend the time. This causes lost work and frustration.
-   Undisclosed Link Behavior: Links that open in the same tab without any warning disrupt my workflow. I often need the previous tab for quick reference, forcing me to open links in new tabs by right-clicking.

These design flaws slow me down. While I try to manage, they make doing things online extremely frustrating. This often forces me to ask for help, affecting my privacy and autonomy. Inaccessible website design is demeaning.

I'm not seeking special treatment—equal access. Digital accessibility helps everyone, not only people with disabilities. Focusing on inclusive design from the start of a project lets us create a more thoughtful and functional world. As you build anything—be it a website, app, service, or physical space—ask yourself, "Who might I leave out?" Please commit to the critical work of inclusion.
