Web site content relating to disability and accessbility in the United States is changing. Over the next few months, resources that many professionals and advocates reference may be pulled from the web. This includes government or government-funded web sites that include host:
- disability statistics,
- accessibility information,
- reference diagrams on accessibility, or
- other related accessibility and disability information.

So you have this material in the future, we recommend you:
1. Make sure that the Internet Archive is indexing the content, and
2. If it is not, add the urls to the Internet Archive.

Detailed instructions are below.

1. Go to https://archive.org/
2. Select Web from the top menu
3. Enger the URL in the visually labeled "Wayback Machine" search field. (Hint: You have to arrow down through the submenus and the text for screen readers reads "enter URL or keywords")
4. If you receive a calendar listing, then the Internet Archive is scanning that page. If you receive a message "Hrm. Wayback Machine has not archived that URL" then you should request it be added.

##Add  urls you use to the Internet Archive
If you searched for the URL and received a message stating the URL is not archived, then you can enter the URL in the "Save this URL in the Wayback Machine" field slightly further down the page. 

The other way to do this is to:
1. Go to https://archive.org/
2. Select Web from the top menu
3. Enter hte URL in the field visually labeled "Save Page Now." Unforutnately, this field does not have a clear label and often reads "https://"
