We have posted the list of 2024 [disability-related awareness dates](https://www.ta11y.org/learning/topic?key=plan.z_holidays) on *ta11y.org*. Our goal is to provide a list of the calendar dates and links to content you can use to help raise awareness within your organization and community.

Not sure how to get started?

- Read through the list and pick a few disability related events you or your organization would like to highlight
- Read through the linked content and search for additional information. Not all events have updated information yet this year but often a search will lead to content that you use from previous years.
- Plan a few actions to raise awareness. Some ideas are:
  - Post on social media on that day and link to the content
  - Share information with coworkers or customers
  - Offer a discount for anyone who mentioned the event

If you have suggestions for additions or revisions to the list, please let us know at [info@accessiblecommunity.org](mailto:info@accessiblecommunity.org).
