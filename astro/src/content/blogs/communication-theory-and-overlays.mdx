When I was studying for the comprehensive exams for my PhD, I studied
<ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_communication" inline={true}>communication
theory</ExternalLink>. It has become a running joke in my house that my daughter’s early
bedtime stories were often research papers instead of fairy tales. \[Reading in a
gentle voice\] "Once upon a time there was a communication model called the
Shannon-Weaver model and this model says..."

As the executive director of Accessible Community and the Co-chair of the
<ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/" inline={true}>Accessibility
Guidelines Working Group</ExternalLink>, I spend a lot of time considering solutions to
accessibility and where digital accessibility standards are going. Part of that is
thinking about how solutions fit into the infrastructure we build in the world.
I thought I’d share an “aha” moment I had about overlays and why I believe they
ultimately fail to solve the accessibility problem.

As background, “Overlays are a broad term for technologies that aim to improve the
accessibility of a website. They apply third-party source code (typically JavaScript)
to make improvements to the front-end code of the website” (quoted from the
<ExternalLink href="https://overlayfactsheet.com/" inline={true}>Overlay Fact
Sheet</ExternalLink>). These technologies are added to (overlayed) website code.
Often they include a widget for the user to interact with to customize the website.

I should note that this article isn’t about the moral failure of overlay marketing
strategies – plenty has been written about that. It’s the result of stepping back and
asking the question: "If overlays worked well, where would they fit in the accessibility
ecosystem?" And my answer, leaning on communication theory, is not where they sit
right now. I will add that this is my opinion and does not reflect the various places
I work.

The <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Models_of_communication#Shannon_and_Weaver" inline={true}>Shannon-Weaver
Model</ExternalLink> of communication theory is an older model (1948) and academics
would rightly argue that a newer model might be a better basis for discussion.
However, the beauty of the Shannon-Weaver Model is that it's easy to understand.
Since this is a blog and not a research paper, let’s agree to use the simpler model
and move on.

In summary, the Shannon-Weaver Model states that a message is communicated using a
**Signal** that goes from an **Information Source** through a **Transmitter** to a
**Receiver** to reach its **Destination**. The message can be distorted when it is
changed into a signal or back again. **Noise** can be introduced in between the
**Transmitter** and **Receiver**.

Communication issues occur when the message is sent from the **Information Source**
in a form the **Destination** can’t perceive or understand.

From a web accessibility ecosystem perspective we can think of this model as follows:
* The author (**Information Source**) is the person sending the message,
* The browser (**Transmitter**) presents the message through HTML and CSS (**Signal**),
* Assistive technology (**Receiver**) translates the **Signal** into a form the 
  person with a disability (**Destination**) can perceive and understand.

<ImageFigure src={overlayModel} class="my-2" alt="Information moves from left to right. The Author (Information Source) sends a message through the Browser (Transmitter). Assistive Technology (Receiver) changes the received signal into a message for the Person with a Disability (Destination)." />

The author and browser work together to present the information as a signal that can
be interpreted by the assistive technology. In WCAG terms, it creates a programmatic
signal that the receiver can adapt to various sensory presentations (voice, braille,
etc). The goal of a programmatic signal (text in the current technological environment)
is to provide as universal a message as possible so that the receiver can translate it.
For example:
* Screen readers and text-to-speech take text and change the signal into voice,
* Magnifiers change the color and size of the text,
* Language translation programs and AI convert the text into a form that the destination
  can understand.

The challenge with overlays is that they attempt to put the translation portion on the
wrong side of the communication channel. They attempt to translate the signal being
received by assistive technology on the right side of the diagram, while sitting on
top of the transmitter (aka the browser) on the left side of the diagram. To do this,
overlays have to account for all the ways that the signal could be interpreted and
send those variations over to the receiver. In short, they add a lot of noise.

In order to work well, overlays should either:
* sit between the author and the browser and help the author create as clean a signal
  as possible, or
* be used by the receiver as a form of assistive technology.

If overlays were given to authors as a way to improve the message by evaluating pages
and suggest corrections for consideration, they could fill a need for an intuitive way
for novices to create accessible pages. If overlays were provided to people with
disabilities as a way to better understand the message that was sent, they could add
to the suite of tools individuals with disabilities have to perceive and understand
content. Giving control of overlays to people with disabilities would reduce the noise
they create in their current position.
