Inspired by Sam Bentley’s ongoing good news video series, we are bringing visibility to disabilities by spotlighting a few of our favorite uplifting news stories on disability inclusion and accessibility from last month\!

**January 28th**: Canada’s new Digital Technologies Accessibility Regulations focus directly on digital technologies and apply to all federally regulated organizations. The explicit regulatory requirements shift accessibility from policies and reporting to technical standards, testing, documentation, and ongoing maintenance.

**January 27th:** Abena Christine Jon’el brought disability pride to a fashion show in Ghana when she walked the runway with her prosthetic leg wrapped in a beautiful eye-catching African print. Abena wants Ghanaians to see disabled people as they are: ambitious, stylish, talented, complex, proud, and human. Abena wisely states that “Having a disability is not what makes you disabled. Lack of support, lack of accessibility, that is what disables you.” Original article: [The model who moved to Ghana and wrapped her prosthetic leg in its famous fabric](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy11q1pwpgo)

**January 26th**: We launched our namesake podcast channel with biweekly episodes exploring life with disabilities and accessibility. You can find us by searching for “Accessible Community” directly on YouTube.com or your favorite listening app. You can also visit [accessiblecommunity.org/podcasts/](/podcasts/) for channel links and additional information.

**January 18th**: A research team at the Korea Institute of Machinery and Materials developed a lightweight robotic exoskeleton that supports the elbow, shoulder, and waist, to improve strength and mobility with reduced muscle use. The team aims to make this technology highly accessible and plans to further improve and expand its use to support other parts of the body.

**January 11th:** Mattel developed the first autistic Barbie doll after more than 18 months of close collaboration with the Autistic Self Advocacy Network. This partnership resulted in intentional design choices for the doll to fully celebrate the autistic community and authentically reflect some experiences individuals on the autism spectrum may relate to.
