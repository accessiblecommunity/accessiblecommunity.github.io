_mutua11y mentoring_ is currently matching mentors and protégés.

Accessible Community coordinates the _mutua11y mentoring_ program in partnership with [Deque](https://www.deque.com/), [Level Access](https://www.levelaccess.com/), [Pearson](https://www.pearson.com/), [TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/), and [Tetralogical](https://tetralogical.com/). This program brings together emerging accessibility professionals with experts in the field. Mentors and protégés meet for an hour several times a month for 3-12 months. Each mentor and protégé set agrees on how often they will meet and for how long.

The goals for our mentoring program include:

- Supplementing limited educational opportunities in accessibility and universal design by providing hands-on experience.
- Helping small businesses and community organizations become more inclusive of people with diverse abilities.
- Building a community of educated professionals by engaging and inspiring them about creating a more inclusive world.

Are you interested in getting involved? Apply as a mentor or protégé at [_mutua11y.org_](https://mutua11y.org/mentoring).
