Transcripts are helpful for accessibility:
* They provided access for people who are deaf-blind and are particularly helpful when they include important visual descriptions (descriptive transcripts).
* They provide a way to access video content for people who would prefer not watch the video as well as search engines. These individuals may read faster, find videos distracting or may struggle with video content due to a disability.
* They provide a quicker way to create clean captions if you are working in a system that doesn't automatically caption and allow you to clean them up.
