Let's start with the basics: I'm Esther Klang. I'm 30, and for the last 19 years, I've lived with quadriplegia, shallow breathing, vocal cord paralysis, and a tracheostomy. When I was ten, doctors removed a brain tumor that changed everything about how I move, breathe, and speak. I rely on Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices and all kinds of Assistive Technology (AT) just to communicate—tools I wish were an afterthought for everyone who builds tech.

But here's the thing: digital accessibility isn't just a box to tick on some legal checklist. For me, it's the difference between living independently and having to ask someone else for help with every single thing. It's about dignity, autonomy, and being able to tell my own story in a world that often pretends people like me don't exist.

[My website](https://estherswalkingjourney.co/) is dedicated to independent computer access, because using my phone and computer isn't just about convenience—it's survival. It lets me shop, work, connect, and express myself. Sometimes it takes me longer, but I'd rather that than lose control over my life.

Let me give you a peek into my daily toolkit. I use [Sesame Enable](https://sesame-enable.com/), a head-tracking app, to control my phone and computer without my hands. [Augmental's MouthPad](https://augmental.tech/) is another lifesaver. Since traditional typing is out of the question for me, I use an on-screen keyboard—one slow letter at a time, purely through head movements. To get my words out, I lean on apps like [Speech Assistant AAC](https://www.asoft.nl/speechassistant-communicator.html) and [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io/) for synthesized speech, and [Voiceitt](https://voiceitt.com/), which is built for people with non-standard speech patterns. Every piece of this puzzle helps me exist online and in the world.

But for all that tech, there are everyday digital barriers that drive me up the wall:

* **Passwords**: If there's no “show password” button, I'm probably locked out after a couple of tries. That means getting cut off from stuff I need—sometimes for hours or days.
* **Gestures**: Sites that demand you drag or swipe with a finger or mouse? If there's no backup way to interact, I'm stuck. No amount of determination can make my head movements into a finger swipe.
* **Tiny Buttons**: Small clickable areas are a nightmare for anyone using head-tracking or alternative pointers.
* **Time Limits**: Sites that log you out too quickly, or without warning, cost me whatever I was working on. And I can't just hop back in and re-enter everything at lightning speed.
* **Links That Unexpectedly Hijack My Workflow**: If a link suddenly opens in the same tab, I may lose my place and all my progress. Having to constantly open things in new tabs just to protect myself slows everything down.

Here's what most people don't realize: these headaches aren't unique to me. Bad design makes things slower, harder, and more frustrating for everyone—just more so for people with disabilities. Every time I have to call in someone else for help, it chips away at my privacy, my autonomy, my ability to just be a person moving through the world.

I'm not asking for anything extra—just access. Digital accessibility is about building technology for humans, not a narrow slice of them. If you create websites, apps, or tools of any kind, take a second to think: Who am I leaving out? Could this be easier for someone with a disability… or just someone new to technology?

Let's build a digital world that works for all of us, from the start. Because what you create can make the difference between someone like me living life on my own terms, or never getting the chance at all.
