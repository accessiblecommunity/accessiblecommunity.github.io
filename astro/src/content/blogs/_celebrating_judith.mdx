As America celebrates its founding fathers who fought for independence, we thought we would highlight a different type of patriot. Judith Heumann is known as the "Mother of the Disability Rights Movement". She passed away in March 2023 after dedicating her life to improving the rights of people with disabilities.

Her TEDx talk from 2017 is called [Our fight for disability rights and why we're not done yet](https://www.ted.com/talks/judith_heumann_our_fight_for_disability_rights_and_why_we_re_not_done_yet). In this 17 minute presentation, Judith provides an informative introduction to disability advocacy in the United States, and the impact of accessibility and inclusion on the disability community.
