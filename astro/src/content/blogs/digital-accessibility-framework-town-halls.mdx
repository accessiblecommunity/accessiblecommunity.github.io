Accessible Community recently released the [Digital Accessibility Framework](https://accessiblecommunity.org/daf/) for public review. This project aims to expand our collective understanding of the requirements for accessible digital content, considering the impact of emerging technologies and engaging with broad user groups to predict their full impact.

A complex project like this needs wide engagement in order to get it right. [DAF Town Halls](https://accessiblecommunity.org/daf/town-hall) provide a monthly opportunity for anyone interested in this work to interact with us. In each town hall, we will explore in depth an aspect of the digital accessibility framework. In discussion, we hope to learn how to improve the framework, find missing aspects, etc. Town halls are also opportunities for you to raise thoughts or questions about the DAF. These discussions are important to help us plan useful next steps for the project.

The Digital Accessibility Framework aims to address accessibility across the entire spectrum of human experience. We find that accessibility guidance needs to be contextualized for regions of the world, language and cultural groups, types of digital technologies in use, etc. We hope to engage participation from people who represent various contexts to help increase the inclusivity of the framework.

Please help us with these goals! Right now, it would be really helpful for you to:

- Spread awareness of this work to people who would be interested, especially ones who have a different background than you;
- Suggest ways that would help you participate in a global effort in our brief [town hall participant poll](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScMMfZ5nwfEMfdrq3wxyQgrG-vakq-OXrPqQNMpiTovv4VTLg/viewform?usp=header);
