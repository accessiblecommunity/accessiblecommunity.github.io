# Inclusive Language

**Why Inclusive Language Matters:**

<ImageFigure src={inclusive_lang} class="my-3 text-center w-100" imageClass="d-block mx-auto" alt="A picture of Judith Heumann from 2014." caption="Why inclusive language matters. When your language is thoughtful and respectvial and gracious, you belong here."/>

Language can welcome people in or shut people out. 

The way we talk about people affects how valued they feel. Inclusive language is about using words that respect real people, real identities, and real experiences.

Outdated or careless language can create barriers without us even realizing it. Thoughtful language opens doors to a world where we can help people feel respected, seen, and valued. 

For businesses and organizations, inclusive language is more than just being polite–it is part of accessibility. It is the foundation that builds trust and connection and shows that you genuinely care about the people you serve. 

When your language is thoughtful and respectful, you send a clear message: *you belong here*. 

**Put It Into Practice:**

* Use people-first or identity-first language based on preference. The key is to not define a human by their disabilities.   
  * Instead of: “the disabled” → Say: “persons with disabilities” or “people with disabilities”   
  * Instead of: "autistic child” → Say: “person with autism" or "autistic person.”   
  * **Always** follow the individual’s lead on their preferred terms.  
* Replace outdated or negative terms with respectful ones.  
  * Instead of: “wheelchair-bound” → Say: “wheelchair user.”  
  * Instead of: “suffers from anxiety” → Say: “has anxiety.”  
  * Avoid labels that imply weakness, illness, or powerlessness. Disabled people are **not** problems that must be fixed.   
* Use language that centers dignity and independence.  
  * Instead of: “special needs person” → Say: “person with a disability.”  
  * Instead of: “normal people” → Say: “non-disabled people.”  
  * Avoid referring to people with disabilities as patients unless it is actual medical care.  
* Ask when you’re unsure.  
  * Try: “How would you like to be identified?” OR “How would you like me to refer to this?”  
* Check your materials for unintentional barriers.  
  * Update forms that say “handicapped” to “accessible.”  
  * Replace phrases like “confined to a wheelchair” with “uses a wheelchair.”  
  * Avoid using phrases like “retarded”, “blind as a bat”, or casually labeling memory issues as “dementia.”
