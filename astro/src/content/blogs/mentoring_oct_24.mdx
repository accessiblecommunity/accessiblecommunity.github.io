The Accessibility Mentoring Program is currently matching mentors and protégés.  

Accessible Community coordinates the Accessibility Mentoring Program in partnership with Deque, Level Access, Pearson, TPGi, and Tetralogical.  This program brings together emerging accessibility professionals with experts in the field.  Mentors and protégés meet for an hour several times a month for 3-12 months.  Each mentor and protégé set agrees on how often they will meet and for how long.

The goals for our mentoring program include:

- Supplementing limited educational opportunities in accessibility and universal design by providing hands-on experience.
- Helping small businesses and community organizations become more inclusive of people with diverse abilities.
- Building a community of educated professionals by engaging and inspiring them about creating a more inclusive world.

Are you interested in getting involved? Apply as a mentor or protégé at [mutually.org](mutua11y.org/mentoring).
