Accessibility work is strongest when grounded in real-world experience. Not in assumptions. Not in checklists alone. In the everyday experiences of disabled people navigating systems that shape how we work, communicate, learn, and participate.

'''Day in the Life''' is a multimedia storytelling project created to do precisely that.

This series centers on real experiences of living with a disability and presents them with care, intention, and professional respect. It is designed for education, outreach, and accessibility practice, with a clear goal: to treat lived experience as legitimate expertise and to share it responsibly.

## Why Day in the Life Exists

oo often, disability stories are framed to inspire or to simplify. They focus on moments rather than patterns, or motivation rather than insight. That framing misses what disabled people know best.

Living with a disability means interacting with systems every day. Digital platforms. Physical environments. Workflows. Policies. Tools that either support independence or quietly create barriers.

Over time, these interactions build knowledge.

Day in the Life was created to surface that knowledge. Not as anecdote, but as analysis. Not as spectacle, but as professional insight that can inform better design, better policy, and better accessibility decisions.

## How the Stories Are Created

Each episode of Day in the Life is based on a full interview conducted by Taylor from Accessible Community.

Participants talk through their daily routines, decision-making processes, access needs, and the systems they interact with regularly. The focus is not on diagnosis or personal history, but on lived interaction with the world as it is designed today.

Every story reflects a different perspective. That is intentional. Disability is not monolithic, and accessibility is deeply personal.

## Participant Control and Ethical Practice

Ethical storytelling is not optional. It is foundational to this project.

Participants choose how they are represented. They may be credited by name or remain anonymous. They decide what information is shared and what is not.

All content is reviewed before publication. Participants can request changes, clarifications, or removal of content at any stage. Privacy, transparency, and consent guide every step of the process.
