If you are looking for an opportunity to discuss current issues in digital accessibility with other accessibility professionals, join us [virtually or in-person at AccessU](https://knowbility.org/programs/john-slatin-accessu-2025) this year for the new Flipped Learning track. 

*Accessible Community* and [Knowbility](https://knowbility.org/) are producing a “flipped-classroom” style track inspired by the 2024 Accessible Canada, Accessible World conference of May 2024. Participants are invited to submit presentations, articles, research papers, and prototypes before the conference. 

Participants will then be asked to watch and read the materials in advance of joining the conversation at AccessU. Facilitators and provocateurs will be assigned to each session and will provide perspectives and responses to some of the submitted content. The audience will be invited to participate in the conversation, challenge and co-create solutions for existing or future barriers, and propose innovative approaches that can further advance digital accessibility.

## Schedule 

### Tuesday, May 13th
* Morning, Challenge 1: How we can use and shape AI so it benefits people with disabilities? 
* Afternoon, Challenge 2: Where does digital accessibility “belong” within organizations and how does that affect career decisions and pathways to leadership? 

### Wednesday, May 14th
* Morning, Challenge 3: What defines "success" in digital accessibility?
* Afternoon, Continuing Conversation: Open discussion topics, led by the participants.

## Proposals

We invite proposals for presentations or reading materials on these topics.  Proposals should be submitted at [New for 2025 - Flipped Learning Track](https://knowbility.org/programs/john-slatin-accessu-2025/new-for-2025-flipped-learning-track) by March 31st.
