import ExternalLink from "../../components/ExternalLink.astro";

Welcome to <span class="text-brand">Accessible **Community**</span>'s new, more accessible website. We were having trouble maintaining our accessibility on the content management system we've been using for the past few years so decided to rebuild.

Our new site uses mainly <ExternalLink href="https://astro.build" inline={true}>Astro</ExternalLink> and <ExternalLink href="https://getbootstrap.com/" inline={true}>Bootstrap 5</ExternalLink>. We will be converting **mutu**a11y over to this framework in the next few months.

My sincere thanks to Brian Montgomery and Alexis for the many hours they have worked to get this ready.

We are striving to be <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" inline={true}>WCAG 2.2 A, AA, and AAA</ExternalLink> compliant and follow <ExternalLink href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/" inline={true}>Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</ExternalLink>. We will be conducting more accessibility testing over the next few weeks.

If you find an accessibility issue, please let us know at 
[website@accessiblecommunity.org](mailto:website@accessiblecommunity.org).
