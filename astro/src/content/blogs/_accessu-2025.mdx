Will you be joining us for the [flipped classroom track](accessiblecommunity.org/blog/flipped) at [AccessU](https://knowbility.org/programs/john-slatin-accessu-2025)?  

If you would like to submit materials ahead of time on one of the three challenge areas but need some inspiration to get started, read on. Below you can find a list of questions for each theme to help you generate content, but let's not limit ourselves to those questions. We encourag you to add any new perspectives or questions you feel would further enrich the conversation.

## Challenge 1: How we can use and shape AI so it benefits people with disabilities? 
* What areas of accessibility can AI help now and in the near future?
* What areas of accessibility will AI be able to help in the future?
* How does the increased use of AI affect accessibility standards and legal compliance?

## Challenge 2: Where does digital accessibility "belong" within organizations and how does that affect career decisions and pathways to leadership? 
* Where does accessibility belong within an organization?
* Is the alignment with Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) useful or confusing?
* Should accessibility be part of D&I, legal, Information technology or elsewhere?
* How do we build career paths for accessibility?
* How do you sell accessibility to leadership?
* Should accessibility professionals aim on being single track or is accessibility a skill within a different career track?
* Where can accessibility have the most impact?
* Where does funding and support come from?
* How have you been successful?

## Challenge 3: What defines "success" in digital accessibility?
* What are ethical considerations in digital accessibility?
* How can the use of accessibility overlays change to better support people with disabilities?
* What is the relationship between privacy and accessibility?..security and accessibility?
* How does digital accessibility fail the disability community?
* Given the hugely diverse needs of disabled persons, how do we support individualization/personalization or one-size-fits-one Web design without compromising the WCAG baseline and without resorting to the predatory and misleading overlay tactics?
* What is the role of standards within accessibility?
