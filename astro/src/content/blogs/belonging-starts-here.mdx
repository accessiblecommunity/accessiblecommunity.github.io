When I first found _Accessible Community_, it wasn't just another tech nonprofit. I found a community filled with real people, many of whom have disabilities and personal experiences with disability. They understand that accessibility always comes first.

Since 2017, _Accessible Community_ has created a movement. They believe that everyone deserves to be included. It's not a slogan; it's a practice. The group's work goes beyond checklists and rules. It's about reimagining communities, workplaces, and digital spaces. They aim to ensure that nobody gets left behind.

## What Makes Accessible Community Stand Out?

Above all, _Accessible Community_ is all about:

- **Sharing Knowledge:** The team doesn't just educate; it also empowers. They promote open discussions on the importance of Accessibility. They also provide practical tools to help break down barriers.
- **Empowering, Not Just Including:** Here, people with disabilities lead and shape the conversation. It's genuine inclusion that keeps improving because it's participatory, not performative.
- **Making Accessibility Good for Everyone:** _Accessible Community_ helps organizations understand that better access is not just fair; it's also a smart business move.
- **Building Bridges:** _Accessible Community_ connects advocates, professionals, and allies, forming a network that learns, grows, and innovates together.

## Hands-On Tools & Initiatives

This group excels at making resources you'll want to bookmark. Most wear the proud “a11y” (short for Accessibility) banner:
- [_ta11y.org_](https://ta11y.org/): Straightforward checklists to help you make websites, events, and places more accessible. They set the bar for clarity.
- [_loca11y.org_](https://loca11y.org/): Find or share local organizations supporting disability inclusion—closing the gap between services and those who need them.
- [_mutua11y mentoring_](/mutua11y/): Think mentoring, study groups, and events with a focus on both disability and emerging tech. Community learning at its best.
- [_globa11y pilot_](/globa11y/): A pilot program bringing accessible tech training to disabled folks in the global south. Because change should reach everywhere.

## Practical Services, Grounded in Experience

If you run a business, nonprofit, or community group, _Accessible Community_ can help you now:
- [_Accessible Escape Room_](/escape-room/): A fun team activity that makes learning about Accessibility memorable. It builds genuine empathy while providing an exciting experience.
- [_Website Evaluations_](/evaluations/): Their team will review your website and offer free tips for improvement—available to nonprofits and most small businesses.

## More Than Words “Nothing About Us, Without Us”

This isn't marketing speak. People living with disabilities play a key role in the _Accessible Community_. Their firsthand experiences inform every solution. When you partner or learn from them, you're joining a conversation—open, direct, and honest.
