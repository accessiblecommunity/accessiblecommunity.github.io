## Introduction

We are excited to share the [_Digital Accessibility Framework_ (DAF)](/daf/) \- a top-down look at the needs of people with disabilities within digital environments. Our hope is this model will advance accessibility standards and research. 

A problem with accessibility standards is that they are reactive. They codify (standardize) solutions that are already widely adopted. For example, standards must pass implementation tests before they are added to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) (WCAG). If websites are not already using a solution, it won't become a standard.

This makes a lot of sense from the perspective of ensuring real world adoption, but it has a few consequences:

* This model of standard creation does not support new technology development. If a new technology allows captions to move around within a 3-dimensional space and no one has done that before, then a standard won't exist to help them decide how to make that new feature accessible.   
* The model doesn't ensure coverage of all disabilities. If a small number of people need a solution \- but they haven't been able to identify it or advocate for its adoption \- it won't become a standard.

For this reason and others, a small group of accessibility experts, led by Michael Cooper, Dr. J. Bern Jordan, and myself, has been asking the question \- **How can we model accessibility needs in a way that will allow us to inform new technology and address the needs of all people with disabilities?** 

The result is the [_Digital Accessibility Framework_](/daf/), which we are excited to share. Michael has provided additional information about the framework on his blog: [Announcing the Digital Accessibility Framework](https://aihal-accessibility.com/articles/announcing-digital-accessibility-framework).

As we have worked on DAF, we've realized that this model can be used to:

* identify gaps in existing standards and research,  
* identify which parts of the technology stack are most suited to addressing specific accessibility needs, and  
* predict the need for and re-envision accessibility standards.

This project, which is a collaboration between Accessible Community and the [University of Maryland Trace Center](https://trace.umd.edu/), can help move global disability research and standard forward but only with more support. 

## The process so far

To create the framework, we began with related work. 

* The [Framework for Accessible Specification of Technologies (FAST)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/task-forces/fast/#objectives) from W3C provides an inventory of user and functional needs for web technologies.    
* [_useable_](https://accessiblecommunity.org/useable/) associates people with disabilities' requirements for use with broader functional categories and known disabilities.   
* Work by ISO on [User Accessibility Needs](https://www.iso.org/standard/71953.html) and the [U.S. Access Board on Functional Performance Criteria](https://www.access-board.gov/ict/#302-functional-performance-criteria)

Building on existing approaches, we created a model that focused on individuals' abilities (called functional needs or functional performance criteria elsewhere) such as vision or hearing.  During our review process, one of the reviewers pointed out work in Canada that uses object characteristics, such as having text or audio, instead of individuals' abilities to approach standards. Based on this feedback, we reworked our model. 

During our second round of review we discussed the results which were more complicated to understand and also made it more difficult to use. 

This third revision focuses on the intersection of functional needs and object characteristics. 

We have mapped existing standards into the resulting framework to test how well it covers needs. 

## Upcoming activity on the DAF

We have a long way to go. Our next steps are to get public feedback to further refine the model and locate funding to support more detailed work. 

We will be providing a workshop at [AccessU](https://knowbility.org/programs/john-slatin-accessu-2025) this year to discuss the model and gather feedback. You can also provide feedback using the [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe1VjhbdUUnh2BIBTfdVlU0AayQi-cM8Ors3ALU8OYohj8bOQ/viewform), which is also available at the top of the [DAF project page](/daf/).

Please also share this with potential funders and other interested parties. This initial work was partially supported by a [NIDILRR](https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research) grant, however the majority of the activity has been  a volunteer effort. _Accessible Community_ is a 501c3 nonprofit dedicated to making our world disability friendly.
