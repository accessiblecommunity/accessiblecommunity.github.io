As a volunteer-led nonprofit, Accessible Community is growing every month. Our support team provides assistance completing a number of administrative tasks such as setting up events and locating internships. If you have a couple of hours a week and are skilled at searching, organizing or coordinating, we could use your help. Our tasking is mainly handled through email and Slack.
