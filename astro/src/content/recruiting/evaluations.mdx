name: Evaluations Team
---

The Evaluations Team tests the web site accessibility of small organizations that can't afford accessibility audits. This allows professionals who are learning about accessibility to practice and get feedback while helping smaller community organizations. We ask that participants review sites using [_ta11y evaluations_](https://www.ta11y.org/evaluations/me) for a few hours each week and attend a weekly meeting.

In order to volunteer for the evaluations team, we ask that you submit an [_Evaluations Team Application Form_](/evaluation-volunteer).
