Rachael has been working in disability-related education, inclusion, usability, and accessibility for over 20 years but when she developed chemical sensitivity a few years ago, she gained insight into just how much of day-to-day life takes place away from the larger organizations she typically supports. Rachael founded Accessible Community to connect people with disabilities to the communities around them.

Rachael is a digital accessibility specialist at the Library of Congress and an adjunct lecturer at the [University of Marylandâ€™s College of Information](https://ischool.umd.edu/). She co-chairs the [W3C Accessibility Guidelines Working Group](https://www.w3.org/WAI/about/groups/agwg/) and was previously a co-facilitator of the Cognitive and Learning Disabilities task force. Rachael has a Ph.D. from the University of Maryland, College Park, and an M.S. from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
