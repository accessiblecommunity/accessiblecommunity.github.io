I thoroughly enjoy learning new ideas and being part of solutions, especially in the world of
accessibility. After losing my sight in my mid to late teens, I quickly realized that the initial years
of blindness are challenging due to natural and digital obstacles that weren't designed with all
users in mind. I also became aware that the training a person receives to adjust to there
disability is only a start when the physical and digital world has not been created with them in
mind. This realization drove me to focus my education and studies on accessibility and
technology. Over the years, I've developed and refined my skills and techniques to address and
resolve these challenges, aiming to dismantle barriers and create inclusive environments for
myself and others. My extensive experience has allowed me to help build bridges, remove
obstacles, and advocate for equal access for all. My mission is to ensure that the digital world
evolves into a place where everyone, regardless of their abilities, can thrive, contribute, and
engage without hindrance.
