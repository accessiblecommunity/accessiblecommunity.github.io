I've worked in Administrative positions, with my last employment as Executive Admin to the president of a grocery wholesale company. In 1996, I became legally blind and couldn't drive to work in my field. Since that time, I've been a member of my local Rotary club. I'm also past president of the club. I've also volunteered as Secretary of my local Lions Club.

I have a Leader Dog named Daisy. I love to travel to foreign countries and cook.
