Michael has been involved in accessibility since 1993, encouraged by a university mentor. After earning a Master of Education degree from Harvard University, he went on to manage Bobby, the first web accessibility evaluation tool. In 2006 he joined the World Wide Web Consortium, where had leadership roles in the development of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) and Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA). With the Accessible Platform Architectures group he worked on engagement of accessibility experts with technology developers, where his ability to understand both technical and end-user perspectives helped bridge understanding and lead to favorable outcomes.

Based in Ottawa, Canada, Michael enjoys running and climbing. At home, he has various hobbies such as making chocolates, baking sourdough bread, making beer, and designing for 3d print.
