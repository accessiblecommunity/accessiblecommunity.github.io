Esther Klang is an accessibility tester, disability rights advocate, and Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC) with nearly two decades of experience in assistive technology and augmentative and alternative communication. After becoming quadriplegic and developing a speech disability following brain stem tumor surgery in 2006, Esther has dedicated herself to ensuring equal access to communication and technology for all. She partners with organizations to improve digital accessibility, supports people with motor disabilities in finding the right tools for independence, and actively tests and advises on innovative AT products. Esther's advocacy is driven by her belief that communication is a fundamental human right and her commitment to making accessibility the norm in every setting.
