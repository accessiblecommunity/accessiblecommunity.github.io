I recently launched as an independent accessibility consultant. [_ta11y.org_](https://www.ta11y.org) has been especially helpful for my clients, who need **easy, friendly advice** on a range of accessibility topics. Many of my best ideas have come from the work I do for _ta11y.org_ and conversations with other contributors, and I have been able to bring these to benefit my clients in a range of industries.
