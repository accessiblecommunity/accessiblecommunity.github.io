Accessible Community's leadership team manages the services and products that Accessible Community provides. We welcome volunteers with an interest in project management, finance, and other leadership skills to apply for consideration in joining this team. Accessible Community strives to be a disability led organization - lived experience with disability is an important part of this area.
