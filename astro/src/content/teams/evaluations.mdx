The Evaluations Team tests the web site accessibility of small organizations that can't afford accessibility audits. This allows professionals who are learning about accessibility to practice and get feedback while helping smaller community organizations. We ask that participants review sites using *ta11y evaluations* for a few hours each week and attend a weekly meeting.
