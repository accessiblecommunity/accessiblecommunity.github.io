At _Accessible Community_, we grow disability-inclusive communities through socially responsible technology. Led and staffed primarily by people with disabilities, _Accessible Community_ embodies “nothing about us, without us.”

Our volunteers make the world more accessible in two ways:
1. We help communities become more disability-inclusive by providing accessibility-related tools and services to community leaders, businesses, and organizations with limited resources. Our tools and services have helped:
   * Small businesses improve access to their facilities and websites;
   * Religious organizations more effectively serve and reach their congregations;and
   * Educational institutions enhance their student resources and web content.
2. We also help people with disabilities and disability-based professionals learn, grow, and succeed. We have coordinated mentoring for 55 new accessibility professionals. Many of our volunteers gain skills and build portfolios based on their contributions that enable them to start new jobs, careers, or advanced educational programs.

_Accessible Community_ is a thriving 501(c)3 nonprofit based in Virginia with impact throughout the globe. We are unique because our approach to disability-inclusion focuses on:
* Disability-led, community-centered solutions;
* A holistic approach to accessibility that allows for tradeoffs between physical and digital solutions;
* Privacy protection for people with disabilities; and
* Reputation protection for organizations working in good faith to become more accessible.

_Accessible Community_ has grown for seven years with a small budget. Our volunteer community has been expanding with our impact. Today, dozens of active volunteers donate their time and expertise to support our mission. Our goal is a self-sustaining system where sponsorships for our online tools and sales of our tools and services fund our mission. We aim to raise $200,000 in 2026; it's ambitious, but we can meet it with your help.

The time to act is right now. We have the expertise and the initial infrastructure to stand up a system that can create long term accessibility improvements world-wide. With funding for some dedicated resources in 2026, we can create long lasting change.
