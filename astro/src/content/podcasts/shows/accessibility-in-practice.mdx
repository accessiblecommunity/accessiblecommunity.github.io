Success stories should highlight what went right, whether it's a blog post that landed well, a strong project result, personal development, or a process that genuinely worked.

The goal is not to frame disability as a hurdle to "overcome". The goal is to show real progress and positive change in a way that stays grounded and respectful.

That means keeping the focus on what actually made the outcome successful: the access features, the supports, the collaboration, the design choices, and the conditions that helped things go well. This framing makes the story more genuine and keeps credit where it belongs: on the factors that created success.
To demonstrate, we will interview experts who have changed the way accessibility is viewed within their company or organization, and we will see how small changes can make a big difference.
