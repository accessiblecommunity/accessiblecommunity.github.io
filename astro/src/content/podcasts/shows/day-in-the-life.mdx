Accessibility work is strongest when grounded in real-world experience. Not in assumptions. Not in checklists alone. In the everyday experiences of disabled people navigating systems that shape how we work, communicate, learn, and participate.

A Day in the Life is a multimedia storytelling project created to do precisely that.

This series centers on real experiences of living with a disability and presents them with care, intention, and professional respect. It is designed for education, outreach, and accessibility practice, with a clear goal: to treat lived experience as legitimate expertise and to share it responsibly.
