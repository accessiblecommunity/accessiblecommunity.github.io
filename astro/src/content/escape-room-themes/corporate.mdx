This escape room kit includes puzzles that involve translating braille, number and directional locks, interacting with a computer, and video content.

### Disabilities Supported

- Blind participants are supported through Braille and SeeingAI.
- Captions are provided for audio content.
- We provide a descriptive transcript to be printed in braille for deaf-blind participants
- Individuals with limited fine motor control can solve several puzzles but others on the team will need to manipulate locks and objects using the solution. Dragon or other speech input software can be installed on a laptop to give access to one puzzle.
