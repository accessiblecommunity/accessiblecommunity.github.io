# The Digital Accessibility Framework

Welcome to the _Digital Accessibility Framework_. This project is designed to forecast new accessibility requirements inemerging technologies and to help to discover accessibility requirements for user groups with which we are less familiar (e.g., hyperacusis, agraphia, aphantasia, etc.). Our findings could help develop digital accessibility guidance that arrives in time to be meaningful on new types of devices, and that addresses parts of the population that have not yet been able to contribute to accessibility guidelines development.

The pages linked below introduce the framework. This content is also covered in a [12-minute video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KsCWyA5Ve0), which may help support initial understanding.

## Funding

The incubation phase of the _Digital Accessibility Framework_ was partially supported by a [NIDILRR](https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research) grant but much of the design, content development, and tool development was unfunded. This is a project that promises to help advance the digital accessibility field, which will require greater participation and better tooling. If you are associated with an organization whose mission might interest it in funding parts of this work, please get in touch!
