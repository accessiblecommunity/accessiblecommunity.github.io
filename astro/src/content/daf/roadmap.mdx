title: Roadmap
---

We have had two rounds of review with international experts and hope to get further input from others. In future work on the Digital Accessibility Framework, we plan to explore and fill in the identified gaps in guidance, map guidance to guidelines, address how the guidance statements can be met in the platform stack, and tie in known research and identify research priorities. We are interested in getting feedback from others and building partnerships to move forward.

## Map guidance statements to guidelines

Much of the content in the framework at this time was developed by reviewing several sets of accessibility guidelines. Relevant guidelines for a given accessibility statement are recorded as links, but the current version of the framework does not provide richer data than that. Building a more complete model will support richer mappings to enable better exploration of the relationship between DAF guidance and current and in-development guidelines. Doing this would also have the secondary effect of mapping various sources of guidelines to each other, enabling better coordination in world accessibility efforts.

## Tie in known research and identify research priorities

The matrix also can suggest areas of research, helping us to find existing research and identify new priorities. @@expand

## Develop new accessibility guidance

Viewed as a matrix, the set of guidance statements covers only a portion of the potential topics suggested by the matrix. Its structure supports examination of current guidance and potential extrapolation to related needs. Collecting this into new guidance statements will provide input into future accessibility guidelines. @@expand

## Map guidance statements to solution types

Accessibility affordances in digital content can be provided at one or more levels of the technology stack:

1. Hardware  
2. Platform operating system  
3. Platform software  
4. Content development systems (e.g., authoring tools, CMS)  
5. Content delivery systems (e.g., web browser, office application)  
6. Content authoring practices  
7. Aftermarket content remediation

Content authors need to deliver accessible content, so guidelines like WCAG have generally addressed that part of the stack. Much of the guidance, however, could be addressed in other parts of the stack. Our experience is that accessibility solutions deployed lower in the stack, such as via features of operating systems, provide more effective accessibility at a lower overall cost. But when solutions aren’t available lower in the stack, authors shift higher in the stack instead, using outside support to produce accessible content, which is even more expensive and does not always yield improved results.

While there has been migration down the stack of responsibility for accessibility for some needs, the industry lacks cohesive guidance for it. As the variety of digital technology types increases, it will become increasingly difficult for content developers to acquire the scope of expertise and resources required. Therefore, we need to identify accessibility solutions for current and upcoming technologies that can be implemented by platforms and hardware, and work with industry to achieve it.

Mapping solution types to guidance statements will allow us to explore the potential impact on different sectors of the industry when working towards a goal of universally accessible digital content. This should help guideline developers and regulators make more informed choices about responsibility for accessible content in the future.

## Add dimensions to the matrix

As our work with the matrix helps to build insight, and as more people with different backgrounds review the work, it is possible we will identify new dimensions that are important to the matrix, either expanding the current matrix or forming an alternate matrix. Adding these dimensions would expand our ability to predict new accessibility needs, and would also serve as search filters to allow people to explore the data in various ways.

As an example, some accessibility guidance is only meaningful for content written in the human language for which the guidance was designed, such as requirements addressing typography, language-specific features like homonyms in English, etc. Current standards include some requirements appropriate for English but not applicable in other languages, while also omitting requirements that are important in some languages. This makes it difficult for speakers of those languages to adopt the guidelines as part of international harmonisation. Adding language as a dimension would ensure guidance can be shown only where relevant, and also would facilitate additional exploration of accessibility issues for content in a given language.

## Broaden opportunities for participation

A key goal of the DAF project is to expand digital accessibility guidance and practices around the world. Work to date has taken place largely in the developed world, and has developed practices that work there. While a “trickle-down” benefit was expected in the rest of the world, that has not fully taken hold for a variety of reasons. 

To produce guidance applicable around the world, we need a globally representative set of contributors who can bring new perspectives to the work. This will require that we provide ways for people to work in their own language, and develop an explanation of the vision that is understandable to new audiences.
