## Map guidance statements to solution types

Accessibility affordances in digital content can be provided at one or more levels of the technology stack:

1. Hardware  
2. Platform operating system  
3. Platform software  
4. Content development systems (e.g., authoring tools, CMS)  
5. Content delivery systems (e.g., web browser, office application)  
6. Content authoring practices  
7. Aftermarket content remediation

Content authors need to deliver accessible content, so guidelines like WCAG have generally addressed that part of the stack. Much of the guidance, however, could be addressed in other parts of the stack. Our experience is that accessibility solutions deployed lower in the stack, such as via features of operating systems, provide more effective accessibility at a lower overall cost. But when solutions arenâ€™t available lower in the stack, authors shift higher in the stack instead, using outside support to produce accessible content, which is even more expensive and does not always yield improved results.

While there has been migration down the stack of responsibility for accessibility for some needs, the industry lacks cohesive guidance for it. As the variety of digital technology types increases, it will become increasingly difficult for content developers to acquire the scope of expertise and resources required. Therefore, we need to identify accessibility solutions for current and upcoming technologies that can be implemented by platforms and hardware, and work with industry to achieve it.

Mapping solution types to guidance statements will allow us to explore the potential impact on different sectors of the industry when working towards a goal of universally accessible digital content. This should help guideline developers and regulators make more informed choices about responsibility for accessible content in the future.
