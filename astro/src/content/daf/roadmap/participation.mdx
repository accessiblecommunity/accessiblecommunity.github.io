## Broaden opportunities for participation

A key goal of the DAF project is to expand digital accessibility guidance and practices around the world. Work to date has taken place largely in the developed world, and has developed practices that work there. While a “trickle-down” benefit was expected in the rest of the world, that has not fully taken hold for a variety of reasons. 

To produce guidance applicable around the world, we need a globally representative set of contributors who can bring new perspectives to the work. This will require that we provide ways for people to work in their own language, and develop an explanation of the vision that is understandable to new audiences.
