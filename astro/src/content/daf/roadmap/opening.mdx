# Planned Work

We have had two rounds of review with international experts and hope to get further input from others. In future work on the Digital Accessibility Framework, we plan to explore and fill in the identified gaps in guidance, map guidance to guidelines, address how the guidance statements can be met in the platform stack, and tie in known research and identify research priorities. We are interested in getting feedback from others and building partnerships to move forward.
