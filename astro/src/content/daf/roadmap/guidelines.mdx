## Map guidance statements to guidelines

Much of the content in the framework at this time was developed by reviewing several sets of accessibility guidelines. Relevant guidelines for a given accessibility statement are recorded as links, but the current version of the framework does not provide richer data than that. Building a more complete model will support richer mappings to enable better exploration of the relationship between DAF guidance and current and in-development guidelines. Doing this would also have the secondary effect of mapping various sources of guidelines to each other, enabling better coordination in world accessibility efforts.
