## Add dimensions to the matrix

As our work with the matrix helps to build insight, and as more people with different backgrounds review the work, it is possible we will identify new dimensions that are important to the matrix, either expanding the current matrix or forming an alternate matrix. Adding these dimensions would expand our ability to predict new accessibility needs, and would also serve as search filters to allow people to explore the data in various ways.

As an example, some accessibility guidance is only meaningful for content written in the human language for which the guidance was designed, such as requirements addressing typography, language-specific features like homonyms in English, etc. Current standards include some requirements appropriate for English but not applicable in other languages, while also omitting requirements that are important in some languages. This makes it difficult for speakers of those languages to adopt the guidelines as part of international harmonisation. Adding language as a dimension would ensure guidance can be shown only where relevant, and also would facilitate additional exploration of accessibility issues for content in a given language.
