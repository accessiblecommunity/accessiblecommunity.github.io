## Develop new accessibility guidance

Viewed as a matrix, the set of guidance statements covers only a portion of the potential topics suggested by the matrix. Its structure supports examination of current guidance and potential extrapolation to related needs. There are nearly 6000 cells in the table, representing the intersections of specific individual abilities, content characteristics, and accommodation types. At each of those intersections, we can consider whether there is an accessibility need (or map known needs), which is expressed as a simple statement. As we fill out the matrix, we can look at neighbouring intersections to explore related accessibility needs that could have been overlooked. Over time, we think this will help us to build a comprehensive model of the requirements for digital accessibility. Collecting this into new guidance statements will provide input into future accessibility guidelines.
