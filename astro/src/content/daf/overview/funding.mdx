## Funding

The incubation phase of the _Digital Accessibility Framework_ was partially supported by a [NIDILRR](https://acl.gov/about-acl/about-national-institute-disability-independent-living-and-rehabilitation-research) grant but much of the design, content development, and tool development was unfunded. This is a project that promises to help advance the digital accessibility field, which will require greater participation and better tooling. If you are associated with an organization whose mission might interest it in funding parts of this work, please get in touch!
