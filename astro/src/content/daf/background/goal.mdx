# Background

## Goal

The primary goal of the *Digital Accessibility Framework* (DAF) is to take a top-down look at the needs of people with disabilities within digital environments (accessibility needs). As part of our approach, we are aggregating today's major accessibility guidance within the needs-centered framework and reexamining assumptions used to create current accessibility standards.

We believe the resulting framework can be used to to:

* identify gaps in existing standards and research,
* identify which parts of the technology stack are most suited to addressing specific accessibility needs, and
* re-envision accessibility standards.
