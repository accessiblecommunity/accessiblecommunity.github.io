## Re-examining Past Assumptions

As we worked on this framework, we found it was important to surface some assumptions about how accessibility works and how best to support people with disabilities.  

Current accessibility guidelines and regulations place the responsibility of making content accessible on authors and developers. This occurs even when the accessibility needs could be met by features in user agents or platforms. As a result, a large number of front-end developers dedicate time to separately solve the same accessibility issues in their own products. A more efficient approach would be a small number of platforms and user agents with sufficient resources and expertise creating accessibility solutions that everyone could use.  To produce guidance that will work in the real world, we re-envision the responsibilities of the technology stack (hardware, operating system, user agent, assistive technology, content). 

Recognizing that guidance emerging from this framework will be used for technology of the 2030s and 2040s, we need to forecast how technology, and its impact on accessibility, will change. Digital technologies that provide new types of experiences will intersect in new ways with individuals' abilities and characteristics. The increasing number of new types of technologies will require approaches to accessibility that may not work with separate assistive technologies and accessibility APIs. 

New approaches to content alternatives are being developed. Current accessibility guidance assumes that text is the most basic format for accessibility and relies on it heavily as an accessible alternative to content that requires a user to have a specific ability. We do not assume that text will always work as a universal fallback. 

The social model of disability positions accessibility needs at the intersection of individual characteristics and the environment. The Digital Accessibility Framework attempts to identify these potential intersections to help us to expand this knowledge.
