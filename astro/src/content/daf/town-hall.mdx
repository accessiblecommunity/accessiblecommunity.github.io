# DAF Town Halls

_Digital Accessibility Framework_ (DAF) monthly town halls engage public participation in this promising project. Town hall meetings are scheduled for 10:00 AM US Eastern (14:00 UTC) on the second Thursday of each month. We are looking for:
- disability advocates,
- accessibility professionals, 
- researchers on accessibility and disability, and 
- technologists who care about accessibility 
to join us and explore the framework together so we can create the best tool possible. 

Please complete our [sign-up](https://forms.gle/gnPZYH8gKDui58jv9) form to receive an invitation to the meetings.

Digital Accessibility Framework Overview
- Project led by Michael Cooper, co-led by Rachael  Montgomery and Bern Jordan
- These town halls are monthly feedback meetings on our framework to develop a predictive model for future accessibility needs
- Framework attempts to map what accessibility might look like as technologies evolve
- Three-dimensional approach: Individual Abilities × Object Characteristics × Support Needed
- This is the third major version of framework - feedback led to significant evolution from earlier iterations

Framework Structure & Categories
- Individual Abilities grouped into three main areas:
  - Cognition - relates to understandability, includes cognitive processing
  - Physical - covers motor control, balance, mobility, multidimensional body movement for 3D/VR
  - Sensory - visual, auditory, tactile, plus future senses (olfactory, taste for emerging tech)
- Object Characteristics include content encoding, presentation, surrounding aspects
  - Safety/risk categories cover contracts, financial security, social media algorithms
  - Privacy considerations under safety umbrella
- Support Needed types: Default, Assistive Technology, Support, Avoid, Alternative

Key Feedback & Areas for Improvement
- Mental health doesn’t belong as standalone category - creates functional needs across other areas
- Cognitive space needs most work - suggestions to shift “learning” to “knowledge”
- Neural privacy issues for brain-computer interfaces need integration
- Ethical dimension missing - right to know for alpha/beta testing participants
- Knowledge and consent concepts need clearer placement in framework
- Connection to established ethical frameworks should be more explicit

Engagement & Future Plans
- Contributors list available on website - seeking community involvement
- Focus on cognitive space revisions for next meeting
- Need broader engagement:
  - People with lived disability experience
  - Different global regions and languages
  - Non-English speaking perspectives

Project Goals & Scope
- Not replacing existing standards (WCAG) but informing them
- Supporting both standards development and accessibility research
- Identifying research gaps and coverage areas
- Demonstrating which parts of technology stack should handle accessibility
- Framework for new technology developers to consider accessibility proactively
- Covers all digital technologies including VR, IoT, emerging interfaces
