# DAF Town Halls

_Digital Accessibility Framework_ (DAF) monthly town halls engage public participation in this promising project. Town hall meetings are scheduled for 10:00 AM US Eastern (14:00 UTC) on the second Thursday of each month. We are looking for:
- disability advocates,
- accessibility professionals, 
- researchers on accessibility and disability, and 
- technologists who care about accessibility 
to join us and explore the framework together so we can create the best tool possible. 

Please complete our [sign-up](https://forms.gle/gnPZYH8gKDui58jv9) form to receive an invitation to the meetings.

Continuing discussion of [Support needed](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Support) categories, the group decided the "Assistive Technology" should be renamed to "Adapt". Because "Avoid" is also an adaptation, it could merge with this. "Adjust" is also adaptation that would merge with this. From this discussion, the support needed categories might become:

* Alternative
* Adapt
* Default

Exploring some of the [background thinking](https://aihal-accessibility.com/articles/design-approaches-from-normal-curve), it was observed that the term "normal" is overloaded and that "statistical distribution" would be preferred. Also the statistical distribution is not the most precise model of reality, and it is important to find a good balance of precision and usefulness. It will be important for the framework to be clear about the validity of models it develops and uses. 

Conversation moved on to ways to expand our reach across user groups. Accessibility itself includes consider adaptations of the individual such as physical therapy, wheelchairs, training, etc. This means there is a blurry line, both practically and ethically, between providing accessibility by changing the person vs by changing the content.

A proposed basic problem description that the DAF seeks to address: "make it so any person can use any built object". This goal needs to be clear in communication about the framework. Ultimately, we want the framework to help us see beyond our local knowledge, to gain an overview of the broader problem and solution space we seek to address.

Completing the walkthrough of the framework concepts, this town hall focused on the [support needed](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Support) categories:

* [Default](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Default) - discussed implications of the term "default" and the nature of its position in accessibility space;
* [Avoid](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Avoid) - questioned whether it means avoiding or suppressing content, and whether that is just an adjustment.
* [Assistive Technology](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/AssistiveTechnology) - explored the line between AT and inbuilt support features. A concern was raised that, unless AT is universally available, a model that allows AT as a solution will be biased against people without access to it. Gregg referenced an [alternate approach](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1M4aKIRkhi_WDUcL6meTkParVFeZuoD6d) to AT.

<summary>13 November 2025</summary>

The focus of this town hall was a walkthrough of the current set of [object characteristics](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Characteristics), to gauge understanding and explore what was needed to fully explain them. Using a cherry-picking approach, we started by looking at a couple items in the [Perceive](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Perceive) category: [Static content](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Static-content) and [Time based content](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Time-based-content), with discussion of blurring lines between those. 

Then we moved to explore a category that is less familiar: [Efficiency / Efficacy](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Efficiency-Efficacy) and captured discussion of what it means, then explored [Quality](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Quality).

[Risks](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Risks) as a category introduces some newer thinking about the scope of accessibility requirements. In exploration of [Privacy](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Privacy), the group identified many related issues and decided to make it a new category parallel to risks. [Technological complexity](https://github.com/michael-n-cooper/daf-data/wiki/Technological-complexity) is another safety issue that currently has a somewhat vague definition, with many suggestions about aspects of it.

<summary>9 October 2025 (edited AI summary)</summary>
This town hall focused on a walkthrough of the individual abilities used in the framework, including sensory, mobility, and cognitive. The Sensory category currently includes the five recognized senses: Visual, Auditory, Tactile, Olfactory, and Gustatory. This sparked a discussion on whether to include other senses, such as proprioception (position in space), and how to broaden the definition of tactile to cover emerging sensations like temperature and chemical delivery in immersive environments. The Cognitive category addresses a broad space and the current list of abilities is a first attempt to distill from various references. There are different ways to do this and participants reviewed an in-progress restructuring of this category.

In discussion after the walkthrough, one participant asked if the framework's identified issues would map to an Accessibility Conformance Report (ACR), which is typically based on current guidelines like WCAG. The presenters clarified that while the framework references existing guidelines where applicable, its goal is to be forward-looking. It is designed to capture issues and requirements that go beyond current standards, helping to inform the development of future accessibility guidelines, such as WCAG 3, rather than being strictly limited to what is required right now.

Digital Accessibility Framework Overview
- Project led by Michael Cooper, co-led by Rachael  Montgomery and Bern Jordan
- These town halls are monthly feedback meetings on our framework to develop a predictive model for future accessibility needs
- Framework attempts to map what accessibility might look like as technologies evolve
- Three-dimensional approach: Individual Abilities × Object Characteristics × Support Needed
- This is the third major version of framework - feedback led to significant evolution from earlier iterations

Framework Structure & Categories
- Individual Abilities grouped into three main areas:
  - Cognition - relates to understandability, includes cognitive processing
  - Physical - covers motor control, balance, mobility, multidimensional body movement for 3D/VR
  - Sensory - visual, auditory, tactile, plus future senses (olfactory, taste for emerging tech)
- Object Characteristics include content encoding, presentation, surrounding aspects
  - Safety/risk categories cover contracts, financial security, social media algorithms
  - Privacy considerations under safety umbrella
- Support Needed types: Default, Assistive Technology, Support, Avoid, Alternative

Key Feedback & Areas for Improvement
- Mental health doesn’t belong as standalone category - creates functional needs across other areas
- Cognitive space needs most work - suggestions to shift “learning” to “knowledge”
- Neural privacy issues for brain-computer interfaces need integration
- Ethical dimension missing - right to know for alpha/beta testing participants
- Knowledge and consent concepts need clearer placement in framework
- Connection to established ethical frameworks should be more explicit

Engagement & Future Plans
- Contributors list available on website - seeking community involvement
- Focus on cognitive space revisions for next meeting
- Need broader engagement:
  - People with lived disability experience
  - Different global regions and languages
  - Non-English speaking perspectives

Project Goals & Scope
- Not replacing existing standards (WCAG) but informing them
- Supporting both standards development and accessibility research
- Identifying research gaps and coverage areas
- Demonstrating which parts of technology stack should handle accessibility
- Framework for new technology developers to consider accessibility proactively
- Covers all digital technologies including VR, IoT, emerging interfaces
