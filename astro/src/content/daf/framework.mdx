# Framework

The _Digital Accessibility Framework_ is set up as a multilevel matrix. 

At the highest level, the framework maps the relationship between:

* **Individual Abilities** \- Characteristics of the person using digital content such as the ability to see or understand numerical concepts,  
* **Support Needed** \- such as providing alternative content, and   
* **Object Characteristics** \- Properties of the digital content being presented such as whether it has audio, numbers, movement, etc.

## Synopsis

The *Digital Accessibility Framework* models the interaction between an individual\'s ability the characteristics of the object they are interacting with. When a disconnect occurs, then one of several accommodation types needs to be provided. By exploring the intersection of the person and the digital content, the model allows us to identify and predict potential issues.

## Support Needed

* **Assistive Technology \-** The accommodation supports assistive technology, user agents, user preferences, etc. acting on the content  
* **Adjust**  \- The accommodation allows the user to adjust the presentation or interaction  
* **Alternative** \- The accommodation re-presents the content or interaction in another form  
* **Avoid** \- The accommodation allows the user to avoid the content or interaction  
* **Default** \- The accommodation requires the content or interaction be presented a certain way or within a defined range
