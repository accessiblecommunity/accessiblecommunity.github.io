## Synopsis

The *Digital Accessibility Framework* models the interaction between an individual\'s ability the characteristics of the object they are interacting with. When a disconnect occurs, then one of several accommodation types needs to be provided. By exploring the intersection of the person and the digital content, the model allows us to identify and predict potential issues.
