# Framework

The _Digital Accessibility Framework_ is set up as a multilevel matrix. 

At the highest level, the framework maps the relationship between:

* **Individual Abilities** \- Characteristics of the person using digital content such as the ability to see or understand numerical concepts,  
* **Support Needed** \- such as providing alternative content, and   
* **Object Characteristics** \- Properties of the digital content being presented such as whether it has audio, numbers, movement, etc.

![Three boxes in a row. Individual Abilities is on the left with a two way relationship with Support Needed. Content Characteristics is on the right with a two way relationship with Support Needed.](/images/daf/framework.svg)
