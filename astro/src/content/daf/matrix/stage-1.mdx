# Stage 1 matrix

We originally centered the framework on the commonly used “Functional needs” but found that in sufficient. We then flipped the entire framework to echo work being done on standards in Canada and focused on the content characteristics. What we discovered was that both are insufficient. The current matrix reflects that disability is an interaction between the environment and the individual. 

[Current Draft Matrix](https://michael-n-cooper.github.io/daf-front/matrix-accommtype/)

Each cell represents an intersection of the individual abilities, accommodation types, and object characteristics. The resulting accessibility needs reflect the interplay of an individual’s characteristic, the features of the accessible object, and the type of accessibility accommodation needed to overcome barriers that result. 

Accessibility needs are expressed as [guidance statements](https://michael-n-cooper.github.io/daf-front/guidance-statements). Guidance statements are short statements of the user’s specific functional need, and what accessibility accommodation will address this need. These statements are not technical and do not consider how the need might be met, they simply document the need. Each statement is mapped to one or more specific triples of functional need, user need, and user need context.

The matrix shows the guidance statements in cells according to their mappings. The matrix is reduced to 2 dimensions by repeating the user need contexts for each user need. Statements appear in all the cells for which they have mappings.

At the top of the table, there are some checkboxes to activate features to help explore the matrix:

* “Show cell position” adds a light shadow to all cells in the row and column over which the mouse is positioned, to help visually track the relationships expressed in the table.  
* “Show same statements” changes the colour and weight of all instances of a given accessibility statement in the table, when the mouse is positioned over one of them.  
* “Fit matrix” scales the table down to the width of the browser window. Doing this rather than browser sizing allows some readability optimizations. In browsers that support it, moving the mouse over a table cell with guidance statements will open a popover containing the contents of the cell displayed at the original font size.
