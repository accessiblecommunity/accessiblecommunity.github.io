## Reasons for the project

The Digital Accessibility Framework responds to several challenges we see facing the field of accessibility:

1. Accessibility guidance is generally developed in response to observed accessibility challenges. This process is reactive rather than proactive and it favours larger user groups and those better able to participate in the process of developing solutions.   
2. New types of technologies are released at an increasing rate. Each major innovation can expose previously unidentified accessibility challenges. Addressing the changing environment and user needs requires:  
   * an ability to predict how technologies are likely to evolve, and   
   * a broader knowledge about human variability and how that may interact with the design of new technologies.  
3. Many accessibility standards are built on a set of assumptions which may or may not still be true. The changing nature of technology requires reexamining assumptions inherited from previous accessibility standards.  
4. Currently, most accessibility guidance places responsibility on content creators. While this is necessary for some situations, many accessibility requirements can be supported by the user agent, content management system, platform technology, etc. We hope to demonstrate the benefits to the industry of moving the point of responsibility away from the author.  
5. Current accessibility guidance is born for the web and then adapted to other digital technologies such as desktop software, games, mobile applications, virtual reality, and kiosks. 

To respond to these challenges, we plan to:

1. Create a framework of disability related user needs that applies across technologies;  
2. Test the framework by populating it with existing guidance and research and identify gaps in existing efforts;  
3. Re-envision accessibility guidance using a different approach and set of assumptions, and  
4. Inform future accessibility solutions and guidance so that the digital accessibility environment can better support people with disabilities for years to come.  
5. Focus on the broader set of digital technology from the beginning.
