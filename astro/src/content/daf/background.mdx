# Background

## Goal

The primary goal of the *Digital Accessibility Framework* (DAF) is to take a top-down look at the needs of people with disabilities within digital environments (accessibility needs). As part of our approach, we are aggregating today's major accessibility guidance within the needs-centered framework and reexamining assumptions used to create current accessibility standards.

We believe the resulting framework can be used to to:

* identify gaps in existing standards and research,
* identify which parts of the technology stack are most suited to addressing specific accessibility needs, and
* re-envision accessibility standards.

## Reasons for the project

The *Digital Accessibility Framework* responds to several challenges we see facing the field of accessibility:

1. Accessibility guidance is generally developed in response to observed accessibility challenges. This process is reactive rather than proactive and it favours larger user groups and those better able to participate in the process of developing solutions.   
2. New types of technologies are released at an increasing rate. Each major innovation can expose previously unidentified accessibility challenges. Addressing the changing environment and user needs requires:  
   * an ability to predict how technologies are likely to evolve, and   
   * a broader knowledge about human variability and how that may interact with the design of new technologies.  
3. Many accessibility standards are built on a set of assumptions which may or may not still be true. The changing nature of technology requires reexamining assumptions inherited from previous accessibility standards.  
4. Currently, most accessibility guidance places responsibility on content creators. While this is necessary for some situations, many accessibility requirements can be supported by the user agent, content management system, platform technology, etc. We hope to demonstrate the benefits to the industry of moving the point of responsibility away from the author.  
5. Current accessibility guidance is born for the web and then adapted to other digital technologies such as desktop software, games, mobile applications, virtual reality, and kiosks. 

To respond to these challenges, we plan to:

1. Create a framework of disability related user needs that applies across technologies;  
2. Test the framework by populating it with existing guidance and research and identify gaps in existing efforts;  
3. Re-envision accessibility guidance using a different approach and set of assumptions, and  
4. Inform future accessibility solutions and guidance so that the digital accessibility environment can better support people with disabilities for years to come.  
5. Focus on the broader set of digital technology from the beginning.

## Guiding Principles

* Guidance should avoid making assumptions about how a given accessibility need might be met.   
* Guidance must be written using plain language principles to support understanding and translation.  
* Guidance must be evidence based (user research, academic research, etc.)

## Re-examining Past Assumptions

As we worked on this framework, we found it was important to surface some assumptions about how accessibility works and how best to support people with disabilities.  

Current accessibility guidelines and regulations place the responsibility of making content accessible on authors and developers. This occurs even when the accessibility needs could be met by features in user agents or platforms. As a result, a large number of front-end developers dedicate time to separately solve the same accessibility issues in their own products. A more efficient approach would be a small number of platforms and user agents with sufficient resources and expertise creating accessibility solutions that everyone could use.  To produce guidance that will work in the real world, we re-envision the responsibilities of the technology stack (hardware, operating system, user agent, assistive technology, content). 

Recognizing that guidance emerging from this framework will be used for technology of the 2030s and 2040s, we need to forecast how technology, and its impact on accessibility, will change. Digital technologies that provide new types of experiences will intersect in new ways with individuals' abilities and characteristics. The increasing number of new types of technologies will require approaches to accessibility that may not work with separate assistive technologies and accessibility APIs. 

New approaches to content alternatives are being developed. Current accessibility guidance assumes that text is the most basic format for accessibility and relies on it heavily as an accessible alternative to content that requires a user to have a specific ability. We do not assume that text will always work as a universal fallback. 

The social model of disability positions accessibility needs at the intersection of individual characteristics and the environment. The Digital Accessibility Framework attempts to identify these potential intersections to help us to expand this knowledge.
