title: Corporate Conundrum Kit
---

## Scenario

You are our best corporate espionage team. Our newest prototype went missing. We've located the person who took it but we need you to enter a room and find the technology.  

You have 30 minutes to get the tech and get out before you risk detection. Leave the room clean and as close to what it looks like when you enter as possible so the thief doesn't immediately know someone has been there.

Good luck.

## Puzzle overview

- **Computer**: A computer presents a screen with 4 passcodes. Each passcode can be figured out using clues given by other puzzles in the room. (Jester, Baltimore, Spot, Violet)  
- **Codename**:  Photos and Seeing AI. Seeing AI will read the name only on the correct photo. Letter is signed by J narrows the guesses down if they do not figure this out.   
- **City**: clue provided by Braille card in book  
   - Finding the Braille decipher card is required (if no one reads braille)  
   - Braille is redundant on the other puzzles but the ability to read braille is a “superpower” on this puzzle.  
- **Pet Name:** The riddle on the video presents definitions of Spot. The first letter of each phrase (capitalized in captions) also spells out Spot.   
- **Color**:  
   - Directional Lock:  The letter provides the directional combination within the text.  
   - Box with Braille letters:  The letters when organized provides the color   
- **Computer**: Email – final clue for final puzzle, images have numbers  
   - Answer is 35678  
- **Numeric lock finds the prototype:** EZ Button

## Equipment needed

To build the escape room, you'll need to acquire the following items. They do not need to be from Amazon, but we've linked to the items on Amazon to make it easier to find.

### Required items

* Wooden alphabet tiles with letters and braille. We have previously used the [PlanToys alphabet tiles](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00I3VWSIA?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2) but they are unavailable on Amazon. [This alternative from Feifeiya](https://www.amazon.com/Feifeiya-Alphabet-Punctuation-Educational-Visually/dp/B0DSFKLRF5/ref=sr_1_16?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.zfNJP4gK5mZvMbykUiIxamwTOdWUmJIwhs2wmsPjGwF8cAQN3ua1LRsdjLczpzzHbmU5fOLM1W10eB1HyITrf6ZNJpcAHzV5u7j4t7PNXYbb8-FB7oXZPpO6neJ1qQioKWBWCLn377r4I-mUNXwrt-s5o0sWa1aLicc6ip1cYYNrz6-mlHnPif_MK1kMT36hzLVreN1_hQqEJ0udsGsNfnDQrQgRDP2IOuFRU0z68tdbhC1gZeO9YXWHc4l1Lj32fPFVnfMeHi5apIAJkkjjRKUI2SCzYpmA9-iED-7aCOM.IQ-9gWRxjvpTmFGt-7pOq_AJ9eXja16wEI1sc1qC6ZM&dib_tag=se&qid=1744921793&sr=8-16&srs=121042749011) should also work, but if you are able to find the alphabet tiles, those are ideal. The key is that the letter needs to be large and high contrast and there should be some tactile indicator to clearly define the direction the braille should be read.  
* A [directional lock](https://www.amazon.com/Master-Lock-Locker-Directional-Combination/dp/B0845Q2SBV/ref=sr_1_2?crid=GCG9HDU0DSZ2&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.Sy7kTuIJ0JDdCvVN77SfssTlnc93OEyjEYFcqfugEX85Ld4FRqnk8Bv_8Nge_JDUSFD_183M52H9OrmcDw1xxwi5aSpZeIGBSGpVMelvDLxz4utifSjR31mVsPtIcTwkJ4s3cM1VTsQ2715X6DR6HyTwqrIQfWlksZviDhr_3h7IFW7quq4Iw1g-QskpKuJUumW9qkDrCBsIsdB42lL7g1rGOrwe3CnBoYpyRhRSDACOqdHz6K9Rvpyff7gy0UXq37eKCkYpOD4U6ncJS00pTrNFpAxUj-2eOX0lIL_xbSw.IOfw2L77PCqlEIW6ujOzk3N4ZoJACIt6jfE2FBEmIv8&dib_tag=se&keywords=directional+lock&qid=1744924500&sprefix=directional+lock%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-2) \- These are adjustable and can be set to work with the room.

* Two boxes of some type that will support a normal-sized padlock. We often build our own as it can be difficult to find ones that fit the locks. Below are options:  
  * [Stainless steel Storage box](https://www.amazon.com/ToolUSA-Stainless-Steel-Security-Box/dp/B0017QFP7Y/ref=sr_1_4?crid=X1O62B7HLJ2C&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PfDfS5NfvduWrccFNoIS0LRhKBgVGeXjp2DT0EuL9ulqobcsmYN7F7ZAw3c8k8CnBlbbiJC7VenAoXRaoqXLfDW5_88aX_s-u0sUUi8uWao1-A40IGR9THrWSG3W1ka9pz7LLhLGVRi2Im-qIl6I24c-bKbrP61sxT1IOxLb1VQdv9UUYe6AZ_oIZ1UC0EMueeZdLBcyqWbEsv6fZFCU2Zu74vfAMFgsKhZA_Ymuv_OyuEcCVGTLRSQCe5MnL5hOZwq5quBwQPtqPIZSzONaiuBY7h4SC8jK0lVsOp3xBfs.WDBWWctHD2uPCeqnSDkrY3CJBZZBCVlFXtAp0YlcF1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=boxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock&qid=1744926521&sprefix=boxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-4&th=1) \- this box will support the push number lock but not the directional lock.  
  * [Charity collection box](https://www.amazon.com/MCB-Donation-Collection-Mounting-Included/dp/B00VGR295U/ref=sr_1_16?crid=X1O62B7HLJ2C&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.PfDfS5NfvduWrccFNoIS0LRhKBgVGeXjp2DT0EuL9ulqobcsmYN7F7ZAw3c8k8CnBlbbiJC7VenAoXRaoqXLfDW5_88aX_s-u0sUUi8uWao1-A40IGR9THrWSG3W1ka9pz7LLhLGVRi2Im-qIl6I24c-bKbrP61sxT1IOxLb1VQdv9UUYe6AZ_oIZ1UC0EMueeZdLBcyqWbEsv6fZFCU2Zu74vfAMFgsKhZA_Ymuv_OyuEcCVGTLRSQCe5MnL5hOZwq5quBwQPtqPIZSzONaiuBY7h4SC8jK0lVsOp3xBfs.WDBWWctHD2uPCeqnSDkrY3CJBZZBCVlFXtAp0YlcF1E&dib_tag=se&keywords=boxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock&qid=1744926521&sprefix=boxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock%2Caps%2C167&sr=8-16&th=1) \- I haven't tried this but it looks like it will work.   
  * Find a decorative briefcase or suitcase that can fit a padlock.  
  * Build your own \- Both [Michaels](https://www.michaels.com/) or [Hobby Lobby](https://www.hobbylobby.com/) have decorative boxes like this [treasure box](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092PZJ4NF/ref=sbl_dpx_decor-boxes_B084MMTZZF_00?keywords=decorative%2Bboxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock&th=1) with fairly thick sides. You can purchase [hasps](https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/D05F7A9B-3981-4B5D-8818-ED8EBDFFD834/search?lp_asin=B000BP7M96&ref_=ast_bln&store_ref=bl_ast_dp_brandLogo_sto&terms=hasp) that will blend with the box's look and size. Find the shortest screws that will work with the hasp... we suggest 1/4 inch wood screws with a flat head, as these typically do not require drilling.   
* A computer (desktop, laptop or tablet with a keyboard) that can display the provided web page.  
* Tablet or phone that can display a video from the internet in a loop. 

### Recommended items

* A leaderboard to track the best results.  
* A printout of orientation or electronic device to read it from.  
* An extra or two of each type of lock, so they can be demonstrated and played with.  
  * It is often helpful to have a second type of each lock to allow people to try them out before they start the escape room.  
* Extra braille cards and extra batteries/cords.  
  * In their excitement, people tend to be rough with puzzle room equipment, so having backups becomes important.  
* Thematic items to hide some of the clues in.  
  * [Book Box](https://www.amazon.com/Vintiquewise-QI003691-B-Decorative-Vintage-Box-Blue/dp/B084MMTZZF/ref=sr_1_17?crid=13YC6EJ3DIPZ9&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UX6YWw73lmENX_azzhPy0Pg1qLoJGBKNY4_vG6Qr6HCFQ-jIIcMPOY08gFfn6Qhe2gZFzfSwzz1EtpZ9jXcPoHwFIXTTA-V1AsU_BImZSr8lrXV7nBvOl6_rwUoIEHgMk9b0J3uBc-454Vaot4Q0uaWSDDVhDjiVGxsfaEzW_Otc4mLTKG9ryDaXp2nzLbTqVw6oleIgO9nejzFsMi6qmXYJVt108LGPa3oaeyHWP4nfrC1sbg5nm21p2Lmc0eNVZl5lcnCzqmDsFOvFNF-cG5VBkEXdwwWA1MMUhuYnuuE.N7V31DbUWo8waHQ5bsKRWST4elMAS-rBVA0A88KcC4c&dib_tag=se&keywords=decorative%2Bboxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock&qid=1744926814&sprefix=decorative%2Bboxes%2Bthat%2Bwill%2Btake%2Ba%2Bpadlock%2Caps%2C172&sr=8-17&th=1) \- A simple item that is fun for players to find things in. We typically add it to a stack of real books.  
  * A trash can, preferably short and definitely clean.

Other decorations to help establish the theme and get your participants in the mood. This includes a briefcase, pads of paper or notebooks, books (to use with the book box), pens/pencils, a fake plant or two, etc. If hosting in an office or conference room, use random office supplies or decorations from the surrounding area.

## Component setup

Remember to charge all equipment the night before. The computer should be plugged in during the escape room.  Other items should be plugged in during or between sessions.

### Computer

1. Plug in the computer. Turn it on and log in, if necessary.  
2. Install NVDA or JAWS.   
3. Load the given web page to get to the Login Screen with name and password fields.   
4. If the computer runs Windows, press F11 to hide the browser.  
   * If you have a way to put the computer on kiosk mode, this will help you run the room.  
   * If you have an apple product, use guided access (see instructions under Video) and voiceover

### Prototype EZ Button and Numeric Lock

1. Ensure the batteries are fresh.  
2. Record the following: 
   > Congratulations\! You have found the Accessibility Easy Button. With just one click everything within five feet will be made accessible. Available on April 1st.
3. Place the EZ button in the box  and lock it with the numeric lock.

### Photographs

1. Spread the photos around in an area or hide the photos in a file cabinet.

### iPhone

1. Install the SeeingAI application onto the phone.  
2. Configure SeeingAI to recognize the correct photograph  
   1. Open SeeingAI  
   2. Turn it onto Person mode.   
   3. Click the person list button on the left of the camera button.   
   4. Add person.  
   5. Take 3 photos of the Jester photo  
   6. Name the person Jester.   
   7. Double check that when seeing AI is on person mode it now says “Jester”  
3. During the orientation, demonstrate Seeing AI on another participant and some text.  
4. Hand it to the group or leave it with the photos.

### Braille Cityname Card

1. Place the braille card into a book box, drawer or other slightly hidden place in the room.

### Letter Scramble and Directional Lock

1. [Configure the directional lock](https://www.masterlock.com/support/instructions/Speed_Dial_1500iD_Instructions) to have the following combination:  
   `Up, Left, Left, Up.`  
2. Mixup the puzzle pieces randomly and place them in one of the lockable boxes.  
3. Place the directional lock on the lockbox and lock it.

### Letter

1. Place the hint letter in an envelope and place it on a desk or table (to speed things up) or hidden in the room (to slow things down).

### Braille Translation Card

1. If you have an additional hidden place, put the braille alphabet guide in there (trash can, desk drawer or other place). If not, display it on a desk or table, or consider having on the floor in a corner that's relatively easy to get to.

### Video (TV, iPad or Tablet)

1. The link for the video is [https://youtu.be/a7nH3ZC7Vho](https://youtu.be/a7nH3ZC7Vho).   
2. If you are playing the video on the iPad, put it into “Guided Access” mode to restrict it to the YouTube app (or Safari, if you're accessing YouTube from a browser).  
   1. Enable Guided Access under Settings \> Accessibility \> Guided Access  
   2. Open Passcode Settings and set a passcode. If you are locking multiple devices, we recommend using the same passcode for each and write it down on these instructions.  
   3. Open the application (YouTube or Safari) and load the video link above.   
   4. Triple click the home/side button on the iphone. It will prompt you about Guided Access. Click Start.  
   5. To end, triple click the home/side button again and then enter the passcode.

## Room layout suggestions

As you are laying out the escape room, consider the following:

* Ensure that there is plenty of room and open space. Remember that multiple people will need to gather around each item (or set of items).   
  * Conference or folding tables work well, and items can be placed at each end of the table(s).  
  * For items needing power (laptop, video/tv), do your best to ensure that the power cords will not be a tripping hazard for your audience.  
* How you lay out the room affects how long it takes people to complete it.  
  * If you need to extend the experience, separate related clues in the room. The amount of clues you hide (in a trash can, desk drawer, file cabinet, etc) will also lengthen the time it typically takes to solve.  
  * Place related clues closer together if you need to reduce the amount of time the puzzle takes.  
* Make the room feel like it's a work space (or hotel room) to lean into the theme.  
  * Consider leaving some items on a work surface, such as the hat & bow tie and pictures.  
  * If there is a file cabinet or a desk or shelf with drawers, consider using that to hide some of the clues.   
* If you can, have some seats available. Not only will this help cement your theme of an office (or hotel room), but it will provide those who need it a chance to rest.

## Running the Escape Room

### Scheduling the day

* Hold a trial run or two will help you gauge how long to schedule each session.  
  * Some groups will go really fast, and some will get stuck and go slow. The groups that go fast will provide you with a break in-between the groups.  
  * This escape room is designed to run between 20 and 30 minutes. You can adjust the time by separating parts of a puzzle. For example, if the letter with directions is next to the directional lock,  teams will figure it out much faster than if they are in separate parts of the room.   
* Remember to include time for the orientation and wrap up with each group.  
  * If you have a separate space (and help) where these discussions can be held, this will allow you to handle more groups.  
  * If you do not have a separate space, add at least 10 minutes between groups. 

### Giving an orientation for participants

The goals of the orientation are the following:

* Provide the overview (slides are provided)  
* If the participants do not know each other, provide a time for introductions.  
* Orient all participants to any bathroom and any other accommodations you have available.

As far as the escape room, going over some details will help things go more smoothly.

* Explain how the two locks work:  
  * To reset the directional lock, strongly press the lock into the silver arch twice, then start the directions.  
  * To reset the number lock, push all the numbers up, strongly press the lock into the silver arch, then press the desired numbers down and hit the switch on the bottom.   
* Introduce them to Seeing AI.  
* State that each clue is only used on time.

### Providing hints for participants

To help move things along, sometimes your participants will need a hint. Without getting too specific, here are a couple of good general ones to use:

* Remember that each item is only used once – What haven't you used yet?  
* Read the letter out loud again.  
* Why don't you explore \[location that they missed\] or go back to \[item that they missed\]?

### Providing a wrap up (What your participants learned)

1. Overall  
* With thought and planning, activities can be made accessible.   
* Alternatives such as braille, captions, audio descriptions, sound, and lights can add to the experience and allow more people to participate  
* Technological assistance such as SeeingAI can provide accommodations and allow more participants to play. Sometimes it can even be part of a puzzle.  
* Escape room themes don't need to cause anxiety. They can be fun and still challenging enough for adults.  
2. Photographs  
   * Color isn't required to identify people. When designing, remember to use shapes and other distinguishing features to convey information.   
3. Word Scramble  
   * Contrast and tactile alternatives are an important design consideration for individuals with low vision  
4. Video  
   * Captions and audio descriptions add value to multimedia content  
5. Email  
   * Alternative text supports individuals who are blind and can add value for others was well

## Packing Instructions

* Place the easy button and written version into the \=box. Add packing material to keep items from moving around and lock it with the number lock.  
* Place puzzle box, tactile letters, pictures, alphabet card, and directional lock into the other box.
