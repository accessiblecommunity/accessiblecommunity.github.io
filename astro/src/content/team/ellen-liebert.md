Ellen has long been an accessibility advocate and expert, serving as the Accessibility Technical Lead at a U.S. Government Agency. She helped to drive change within the Agency to foster an environment where information technology can enable and empower people with disabilities. Ellen helped to build lasting accessibility programs, policies, standards, and training courses. She has spent 20+ years speaking, teaching, and writing about accessibility, and building and testing accessible, inclusive, and usable websites for the Federal Government.

Since retiring, Ellen volunteers with Accessible Community working on the Ta11y Learning Content and mentoring accessibility novices to grow their skills.
