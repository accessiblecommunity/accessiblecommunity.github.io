Accessible Community is committed to providing an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment for leadership, staff, board of directors, and interns.

Discrimination is based on race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual
orientation, gender identity, national origin, physical or cognitive
disability, age, genetic information, or veteran status. Discrimination is
unethical and illegal and will not be tolerated.

## Equal Opportunity

Accessible Community is an equal opportunity organization. All applicants will
be considered without attention to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual
orientation, gender identity, national origin, physical or cognitive disability,
age, genetic information, or veteran status.

## Accommodations

Accessible Community is dedicated to supporting the disability community. As
such it strives to select and create accessible products and policies whenever
possible. It also strives to provide accommodations such as sign language
interpreting, audio descriptions, captioning and other services. If an
accommodation is not provided by default, please contact the Executive Director
at <a href="mailto:director@accessiblecommunity.org" class="link-truncate">director@accessiblecommunity.org</a> or the project manager for the relevant program.

## Reporting

Any leader, board member, staff, intern or client who believes that they or any
other affiliate of Accessible Community has been discriminated against is
strongly encouraged to report this concern promptly to the Executive Director at
director@accessiblecommunity.org. If reporting to the Executive Director is not
possible or appropriate, they can reach out to the chair of the board of
directors at board@accessiblecommunity.org.
