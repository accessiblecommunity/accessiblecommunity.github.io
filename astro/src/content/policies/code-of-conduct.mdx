## Code of <strong>Conduct</strong>

Date Last Updated: <time datetime="2023-05-05">5 May 2023</time>

## Purpose

Accessible Community is led and staffed by volunteers. Succeeding at our
mission to establish and nurture disability-inclusive communities depends on
our staff's time, knowledge, dedication, and diversity. As such, we are all
committed to creating a welcoming environment where discrimination and
harassment are not tolerated and individual rights are protected.

The purpose of this code of conduct is to set clear expectations of behavior
between staff in Accessible Community in order to create a positive experience
for all participants. This code applies to all leadership, staff, board of
directors, and interns.

This code refers to several more detailed policies but key points are included
here to promote adoption and understanding.

## Principles

### Support the Mission

I believe in and support Accessible Community's mission to establish and
nurture disability-inclusive communities by helping:

- small-to-medium size organizations become accessible,
- people with disabilities find accessible and disability-support
  organizations,
- emerging accessibility professionals grow their experience and connections,
  and
- senior accessibility experts and organization leaders to collaborate and
  share ideas.

### Mutual Respect and Caring

- I will respect each individual's unique experiences, needs, and perspective.
- I will do my best to be transparent and honest; to communicate my needs and
  keep the best interest of others in mind.
- I will try to treat others as I wish to be treated.

### Value Diversity

Our staff and participants come from all over the world. As a community, we
embody different languages, cultures, religions, races, genders and gender
identities, disabilities, backgrounds and experiences. I have read and agree
to follow the <a href="/non-discrimination-policy">Non-Discrimination Policy</a>.

- I will respect the diverse nature of our community.
- I will support an environment that is free of discrimination and harassment
  for leadership, staff, board of directors, and interns.
- I will strive to value our community's diversity as it improves the quality
  of our products and expands our impact.
- I will approach differences with kindness and curiosity.

### Foster Safe Environment

I have read and agree to follow the <a href="/harrassment-policy">Harassment Policy</a>. All leadership, staff, and
program participants are responsible for fostering a safe environment, free of
harassment. No one should be afraid for their physical or mental health while
volunteering at Accessible Community. I agree that:

- I will strive to foster a safe working environment where everyone is
  accepted and allowed to be themselves.
- I understand that a safe working environment is not free of criticism or
  conflict, but I will handle criticism and conflict with respect.
- I will strive to set an example of appropriate behavior.
- I will report situations of harassment immediately on becoming aware of
  them, whether or not there has been a complaint.

### Assumption of Best Intent

- I will start with the assumption that everyone involved in this program has
  my best interest and the needs of the disability community at heart.
- When misunderstandings or conflicts occur that do not involve harassment,
  discrimination or other unsafe situations:
  - I will seek to talk about misunderstandings or conflicts when they arise
    with the people involved.
  - I will seek outside opinions only after I have tried to resolve the
    problem with those involved.

### Confidentiality and Friendly Professionalism

Accessible Community strives to create a respectful space where people can
converse without fear of it being shared outside the community of volunteers.

- I will be kind and friendly, while setting and respecting personal and
  professional boundaries and behaviors.
- I will respect the confidentiality of conversations and personal
  information.
- I will ask for permission when I want to share any information more widely.
- I will not make statements for Accessible Community unless it is part of my
  volunteer work.

### Respect for Intellectual Property

- I will respect the intellectual property of others.
- I will make reasonable efforts to protect the intellectual property of all
  participants and Accessible Community.
- If I wish to use the materials from Accessible Community that are not under
  creative commons license, I will contact director@accessiblecommunity.org to
  request permission.
- If I wish to use the materials from other individuals or organizations, I
  will research the copyright, request permission from that individual or
  organization when appropriate, and cite the work appropriately.
- I will ask when I am unsure about intellectual property.

### Use Technology Responsibly

I have read through and agree to follow the <a href="/technology-policy">Technology Policy</a>. I agree that:

- I am responsible for my account.
- I will not share my personal USER ID and/or password with another person.
- I will log off when I'm not using my account(s).
- I am responsible for all information accessed and all changes made using my
  personal USER ID.
- I will safeguard personally identifiable information in this system.
- I will not disclose passwords and other administrative information for any
  shared administrative accounts to which I am granted access.
- I will not use any non-public data or technology provided by Accessibility
  Community for any purpose other than for the business processes of
  Accessible Community.
- I will not access, damage, alter, transfer, disrupt or facilitate the
  disruption of or copy any data, software or any other part of Accessible
  Community's systems.

### Reporting and Outreach for Assistance

- I will reach out to the Executive Director at director@accessiblecommunity.org if I encounter difficulties.
- If my difficulties are with the Executive Director, I can reach out to the chair of the board of directors at board@accessiblecommunity.org.
