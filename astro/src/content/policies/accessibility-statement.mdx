## Accessibility And Accommodations

At Accessible Community, we believe that our commitment to creating accessible
communities starts with us so we strive to provide accessible content and
services.

We test our websites and services against <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/" inline target="_blank">WCAG 2.2 A, AA, and AAA criteria</a>
and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/coga-usable/" inline target="_blank"> Making Content Usable for People with Cognitive and Learning Disabilities</a>.

If you find accessibility issues or have trouble using any of our sites or
services, please let us know at <a href="mailto:website@accessiblecommunity.org" class="link-truncate">website@accessiblecommunity.org</a>.

If you would like to request accommodations or alternate versions of content,
please email <a href="mailto:info@accessiblecommunity.org">info@accessiblecommunity.org</a>.
