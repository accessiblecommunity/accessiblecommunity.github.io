As a UX Researcher and Design Strategist I had to learn about digital accessibility. I found it difficult to learn on my own and a friend suggested I reach out to the Accessible Community. I recently joined the Accessible Community as a mentee writing articles under the wings of a fantastic mentor. The Accessible Community has given me a safe place to grow and learn about accessibility and it has given me the confidence to seek the CPACC certification. Thank you for all the wonderful resources, tutoring and for spreading the love of learning.
