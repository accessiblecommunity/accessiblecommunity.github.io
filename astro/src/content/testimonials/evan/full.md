Accessible Community was my first start in the field of accessibility. Joining a community of people determined to contribute to helping the world be more accessible provided me with insight and experience that was unmatched. Through collaboration with others in this community, I learned the importance of empathy, patience, and creativity in problem-solving. These skills not only improved my professional capabilities but also enriched my personal perspective on digital accessibility, and broadened my perspective on how I and others can contribute to transforming the digital and physical worlds to enhance and benefit people with disabilities.
