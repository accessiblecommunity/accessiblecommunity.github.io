Accessible Community allows the collaboration of Digital Accessibility professionals to exchange knowledge and ideas. As a community participant, I was able to revalidate my knowledge and acquire others, improving myself day by day. I am proud to be part of this community that drives the change toward a more accessible digital world for all people.
