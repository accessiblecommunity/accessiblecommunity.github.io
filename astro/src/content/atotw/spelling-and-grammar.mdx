It sounds basic, but correct spelling and grammar play an important role in making sure your content is clear and readable. In particular, well-written content helps:
- People with cognitive and learning disabilities like dyslexia can have increased difficulty understanding content with spelling and grammar errors. 
- People using assistive technology such as screen readers. Incorrect spelling and grammar will force your audience to stop and listen to words letter by letter to understand what they hear.
- Individuals who have difficulty reading or are non-native speakers can have a hard time understanding content with spelling and grammar errors. 

Content with correct spelling and grammar also convey professionalism and trustworthiness. 

## What can I do?

After you have written your content, take the time to check the spelling and grammar before sending or posting. Build these habits into your writing process:
- Turn on built-in spelling and grammar checkers while you write and do a final check when you're done writing.
- Use a more advanced tool to double-check your spelling and grammar, such as:
    - [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
    - [Hemingway](https://hemingwayapp.com/)
    - [ProWritingAid](https://prowritingaid.com/grammar-checker)
    - [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org/)
    - [Ginger](https://www.gingersoftware.com/grammarcheck)
- Review the content one last time or ask someone else to proofread it. Automated spelling and grammar checkers aren't perfect - they can miss nuances that are important for a specific context. 
    - Start by taking a critical look at your content.
    - Try to look at your content from your audience's point of view.
    - Focus on context-based errors that are not always caught by automated tools.
