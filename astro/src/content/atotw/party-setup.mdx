When you host a party, sometimes you know when an attendee has a disability and sometimes you do'nt. When someone with a disability might be attending a party, be thoughtful about the party setup. Hopefully, you are already hosting in a location accessible to everyone attending. If that is not the case, change the location or work with the attendees who will be affected before the event to find solutions so they can participate. Attendees with younger children will also benefit from a number of these accessible planning tips.

### How should I setup?

Below are some planning tips to consider when setting up your party:
* Provide enough seating that people who need to can rest. Extra seating is particularly important to consider when the event doesn't have a planned sit down meal or discussion.
* Make sure walkways between chairs, tables, and other furniture are wide enough for people with wheelchairs, walkers, strollers or really big white elephant gifts to navigate.
    * A quick way to estimate this is to grab a yardstick, hold it horizontally at waist-height and walk around the space.
* Place food, games, and other activities on surfaces between 28 and 34 inches from the floor. Bars and high top tables are typically around 42 inches and well out of reach of individuals in wheelchairs.  When you must place items on taller surfaces, provide a small sample of that item on a lower surface as well.
    * Remember to indicate any food that might cause people with allergies or other food related disabilities. Our tip on [Gathering and Giving Thanks](/tips/thanksgiving-2024/) has more food-related tips.
* Remove air fresheners, potpourri, scented soaps, scented lotions, essential oils and other chemical fragrances from the event area and bathrooms. Baking soda can eliminate odors. Baking cookies or muffins in a nearby oven or using chemical-free candles are possible alternatives to create pleasant aromas.
* Set aside a place for attendees to step away from the party to destress and recharge. Some individuals can find parties overwhelming. Having a quiet space to step away becomes an important accommodation.
* Keep music at a level where it isn't overwhelming. Louder music can be a barrier for some individuals and everyone gets tired trying to speak over loud background noise. Set the music at a reasonable level at the beginning of the party and adjust as people join, rather than starting it louder initially.

Let attendees know about any accommodations you are providing when they arrive. This includes important locations such as the accessible bathroom, kitchen and any quiet spaces you provide. Remember that disabilities can be hidden, temporary and situational - letting everyone know about the options you provide will ensure that those who need accommodations feel comfortable at your event.
