Accessible parking is a more than just reserving spaces per legal requirements. Yes, if your organization does maintain a parking lot, then it should include clearly marked accessible parking spaces for use by individuals with special permits. The number of spaces and dimensions required will vary based on your country and the type and size of your parking lot. The [parking checklist at *ta11y.org*](https://ta11y.org/evaluations) can help you work through those requirements for the United States.

However, there is a lot more to accessible parking than just providing a space or two. Approaching it holistically can help you reach more people:
1. Figure out where the nearest accessible parking spaces are located and communicate that location on your website. 
2. If you have a parking lot, consider adding marked spaces for individuals with special situations who wouldn't have a legal permit. This includes women who are pregnant, parents of young children, and elderly individuals.
3. Consider the entire experience of finding the parking space and getting from that space to your location. There needs to be an [accessible path](/tips/exterior-routes) between the parking and your entrance. If you don't have an accessible path, work out how to get one or figure out another parking location. Sometimes local governments can help fix sidewalks or make changes to public parking, if you reach out. 
4. If parking requires payment, check that there is an accessible way to pay. This includes an accessible path to the payment mechanism and a device that can be reached easily from a wheelchair. As parking payment moves to mobile systems, this becomes easier. 
5. Finally, if you don't have parking, consider where people will be coming from to access your location. If they are taking public transportation or are likely to be dropped off, consider that experience in a similar way to parking.
