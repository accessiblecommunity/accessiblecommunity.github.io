Color can call attention to your content, help sighted individuals quickly perceive and process information, create a mood, and brand a product. However, not everyone in your audience may be able to distinguish between colors:
- Color-blind individuals are not always able to distinguish between colors and generally do not benefit when color is used to convey information.   
- Individuals who have low or limited vision or who use a screen reader may also not be able to quickly distinguish between colors.

## What can I do?

To fix this, add at least one other indicator when the color has meaning to ensure that everyone can understand the information being communicated.

Some examples of additional visual indicators are:
- Adding text or text labels   
- Changing contrast, size or shape
- Including icons or symbols   
- Modifying the texture or pattern   
- Altering the presence, absence or location of information
