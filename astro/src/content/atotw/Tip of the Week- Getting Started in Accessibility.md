# Tip of the Week: Getting Started in Accessibility

# Introduction

	Accessibility can feel overwhelming at first, but getting started is easier than you think\! The key is to approach it with curiosity and a willingness to make small, meaningful changes. Accessibility isn’t about giving anyone an “unfair advantage,” it is more about making spaces, products, and services usable for everyone. 

Here are a few ways you can begin:

1. **Think inclusively from the start**. When designing a website, creating documents, or building a space, ask yourself: “Who might be excluded?” Then, take simple steps to remove those barriers.   
2. **Use assistive technology as a guide.** Tools like screen readers, captioning, voice recognition, or alternative input devices can show you what users experience. Even testing your own website and content with these tools can help identify accessibility gaps. Accessible Communities provides a FREE evaluation of your digital spaces for accessibility.   
3. **Start small and keep learning.** This is a step that is underutilized. Focus on one area first, such as making your PDFs readable or adding captions to videos, then you can expand on other forms of accessibility from there. Accessibility is an ongoing process, therefore, allow yourself some grace and continue to educate yourself and those around you.   
4. **Ask for feedback.** Connect with disabled users or colleagues and listen to their experiences. Their insight is invaluable and often points out things you may have never considered.   
5. **Challenge assumptions, look beyond stigma.** Question the stereotypes you might have been told or have heard about disabilities and accessibility. Look past stigma and see the people underneath. 

# Conclusion

Remember that accessibility benefits everyone, not just the disabled community. Clearer communication, easier navigation, and thoughtful design will end up helping everyone. By starting small and staying curious, you can create a more inclusive environment in any workplace, classroom, or digital space\!
