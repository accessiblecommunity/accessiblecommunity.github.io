When you buy a website, software, platform or other digital service, it is important to include accessibility as a requirement for that purchase. The __third step__ on your way to an accessible purchase is to run a spot check to verify accessibility.

What you should spot check depends on what you are purchasing. If you are buying software that already exists or picking a platform to build on, you can test the software itself. If you are getting a custom website or other custom content, ask to see a previous accessible example that vendor built. If no other option is available, test the website of the vendor you are considering.

## How to run a digital spot check.

Pick 2-3 pages or areas to try out. We recommend picking the main page, a form, and a specialty function or area.

1. Test the keyboard accessibility. Start with the focus at the top (the url for a web page). Then don't touch the mouse. You should be able to do everything with a keyboard that you can do with a mouse. 
    - Move the focus forward with the __tab key__.
    - Use the __enter key__ to activate links and buttons.
    - Use the __arrow keys__ to navigate in menus.
    - Use the __spacebar__ to select items.
    - Use the __escape key__ to close popups and drop down menus.
2. If you are evaluating a web page or web app, enter the URL into <ExternalLink inline href="https://wave.webaim.org/aim/">WebAIM's Wave</ExternalLink>.
    - Ideally, you should receive 0 errors.
3. Strip the view of color. Is everything still readable and understandable? 
    - __Option 1:__ If its a webpage, while you are using the WebAim Report, you can go to `Contrast > Desaturate Page` to view the page in grayscale.
    - __Option 2:__ Install Color Oracle and use it to view the page in grayscale.
    - __Option 3:__ Take a screen capture and look at a print preview in grayscale
4. Increase the magnification/zoom and see if the content remains usable.
    - __On a webpage__, zoom to 400% by holding the __control key__ down and hitting the __plus (+) key__. The magnification shows to the right of the URL.
    - __On a phone__, go to the accessibility settings and increase the icon and text size. 
    - __For a desktop application__, increase the icon and text size using the operating system accessibility settings.
5. Change the color scheme and see if the content remains usable.
    - In accessibility settings on your phone or desktop, change the color scheme to dark mode.

If the spot check is relatively clean, that's a good sign that the vendor takes accessibility seriously.
