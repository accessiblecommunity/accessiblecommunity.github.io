Imagine getting a party or event invitation without any details. You know something is happening but not when or where. For screen reader users, it happens more often than you would think. Many automated event programs send images of invitations instead of actual text content. So do people. 

The problem is that assistive technology can't easily access information in an image. Text may become blurry when magnified and your audience can't adjust the text size relative to other content. Some members may not be able to copy the date or location into their calendar and their phone may not be able to discover that information.

## So, what should I do?

When you create an invitation, use images as accents. Write down all the details in text and then style the content to create the effect you want. In Gmail and Outlook, you can change the font size, style and color. In Outlook, you can also change the background. Below are a few more tips for attractive, accessible invitations:

1. Create an attractive banner for the top or bottom of the email in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) or another design program that sets the tone, but doesn't include any textual content.
2. Use an accessible color scheme. If you don't know how, give [Color Safe](http://colorsafe.co/) a try.
    - Select a color that you want to use and set the text size (for emails likely 12 or 14 pt).
    - Click “Generate Color Palette”.
    - The tool will present options based on a color grouping (green, red, blue, etc.) for you to pick from and include the contrast. For text in an email, look for color combinations that provide a contrast level of 4.5 or greater.
3. Increase the size and weight of the key information such as the date, time, location and how to RSVP. Those details should be findable quickly when looking for them later.
4. Ask about accommodations on the invitation and let people know how to request them ahead of time. Accommodations may include dietary needs, interpreters, accessible locations, large print menus, fragrance-free environments or more. It is always better to ask than to assume. 

May your events be fun and accessible!
