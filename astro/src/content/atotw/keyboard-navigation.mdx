Here's an eye-opening activity that will only take five minutes. Open your web browser on your computer and try navigating a website with just your keyboard. That's right, not a mouse or trackpad, just your keyboard. If you don't know how, follow along.

Let's try it out at one of our websites: [*ta11y.org*](https://www.ta11y.org).

- Use your mouse to place the focus in the browser search bar at the top by clicking in it. You'll see either a highlight or a blinking cursor. If you see a highlight, hit the right arrow key on your keyboard to move to the blinking cursor. 
- Use the __Tab key__ on your keyboard to move forward. This will go through the browser controls and then enter the web page.
    - Hint: Hold the __Shift key__ down while pressing __Tab__ to move backwards.
- As you navigate the page, you will see an outline appear and sometimes a color change. These indicators mark where the keyboard focus is currently located.
- Did you notice the skip link that appears at the top of the page? These links help keyboard users skip over navigation.
- When you get to the Assessments menu item, hit the __Enter key__. This opens a dropdown menu.
- Use the __Up and down arrow keys__ to navigate through the menu items. 
- Hit the __Escape__ key to close the menu.

## What about my website?

Standard personal computer applications from both Microsoft and Apple (among others) are not just keyboard accessible, but can be used with only the keyboard. Your organization's website can and should also be built to support the keyboard. If you are wondering whether your website is accessible, a great first step is to test its keyboard accessibility.

Now that you've got the hang of it, try it out on your website.  A reminder of the keys to use:
- __Tab key:__ Move forward
- __Shift + Tab:__ Move backward
- __Enter:__ Activate a link or button
- __Up and down arrows:__ Navigate menus, drop down items, and radio buttons
- __Space bar:__ Select check boxes

There are several types of assistive technology that navigate the web only using a keyboard. If you can't do things or can't tell where you are in your website, your website is not keyboard accessible. And a website that does not work with the keyboard is not accessible.
