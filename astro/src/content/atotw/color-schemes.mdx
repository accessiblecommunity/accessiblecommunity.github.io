Developing a design system for a corporate brand, ad campaign, website, or similar project always involves color. Color is one of the most noticeable parts of any design, and choosing the correct color palette is an important part of a design theme. 

- Making the right color choices can increase brand recognition, invoke an emotional response, and support and reinforce the content.
- Making the wrong color choices can prevent people with color blindness, low vision, and even some people who are neurodivergent from understanding your content.

While no one color theme can always meet the needs of everyone, a well-designed, accessible color theme can meet the needs of most people, most of the time. There are two guidelines to remember when choosing colors to build an accessible color theme.

1. Use color combinations with good color contrast.
2. Never rely on color alone to convey information.
