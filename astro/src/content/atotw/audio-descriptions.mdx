Audio descriptions describe visual content for individuals who cannot see that content. They support blind individuals viewing media in the same way that captions support deaf individuals listening to media.

There are four main approaches to audio description:

- **Descriptive transcripts** are static supplements to media. They are read separately from the media, but are important to support deaf-blind individuals.
- **Integrated audio description** includes the audio description in the main soundtrack.
- **Standard audio description** is a separate track but is synchronous (occurs at the same time) with the media. The audio description fits into the pauses between the production's natural dialog.
- **Extended audio description** is also synchronous. It pauses the production altogether when the space between dialog is not long enough for all the information that needs to be described.

## What can I do?

Audio descriptions are an important part of creating an accessible experience. However, standard and extended audio descriptions are time consuming and more extensive than most organizations can provide. You can instead focus on providing integrated audio descriptions and a descriptive transcript. This dual approach is less expensive, easier, and supports blind and deaf-blind individuals.

To use an integrated description, presenters should:

- **Include a short visual description when they introduce themselves**, if they are visible on the screen. The person presenting should write their description. A good self-description is one sentence and covers the visual aspects that are important to the person or stand out to the audience. When writing, think about what characteristics may be used to reference you in future conversations. Some examples include:
   > I am a middle-aged woman with silver hair and blue eyes.

   > I am an African-American man with short hair with fade, wearing rectangle glasses, a white shirt, and a blue blazer.
   
   A similar self-description can be used as alternate text for headshots of the presenters.
- **Talk about every point on the slide or presentation materials**. Don't read the slide, but make sure to speak about every piece of content available to your sighted audience members. This includes describing any images that are used to communicate an important point.
- **Provide auditory alternatives to gestures**. This will vary by gesture, but try to tie auditory cues to specific gestures. This may be natural, such as when you shrug to show you are unsure, and your tone of voice also sounds unsure. Sometimes, this requires thought, such as when you gesture to different places within a diagram or on a map. DuringIn these situations, you need to describe the important relationships that are visually apparent. This often takes some practice ahead of time.

Once the recording is complete, create a descriptive transcript by saving the caption file. You can then provide it as web content or text file. In YouTube (and other video sites), you can add it to the video description as you upload a video. For web pages, you can provide a link to the text adjacent to the video file.
