Here in the United States, we are preparing to celebrate Thanksgiving. This holiday is ideally filled with food, friends, family and gratitude. It's one of our favorites.

For Thanksgiving or any food-centered holidays or parties you might host, consider the following tips to be as accommodating as possible:

* Ask ahead of time about food restrictions. This can be as casual as a quick comment when inviting guests or a more formal selection when your guests sign up to attend. Often people with allergies can avoid eating the food but some foods can limit people's ability to attend. Knowing restrictions ahead of time lets you avoid making foods that may cause issues. 
* Inform people about the ingredients in food that may cause people trouble such as milk, nuts, eggs, shellfish, wheat, soy, fish, and alcohol. Mention ingredients when serving food where the ingredients are not obvious. On buffet tables, add labels or provide recipe cards for dishes. Using recipe cards provides an added benefit of finding out which items people liked enough to want the recipe.
* Provide alternatives to alcohol like sparkling cider or mocktails that allow people to participate in toasts and socializing without obviously avoiding alcoholic beverages. 

Thinking ahead about food alternatives helps everyone enjoy. 

At *Accessible Community*, we are grateful you have joined us on this accessibility and disability-inclusion journey. Happy Thanksgiving!
