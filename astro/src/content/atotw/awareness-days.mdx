The list of days, weeks, and months set aside to raise awareness about people with disabilities is as long and diverse as the disability community. As we start off 2024, it is a good time to look through your calendar and consider how to help raise awareness of disabilities in your community. Part of the challenge people with disabilities face is the general public's lack of awareness. Each of us can take a small step to change that. 

We have provided a [listing of the 2024 disability awareness days, weeks and months at *ta11y.org*](https://www.ta11y.org/learning/topic?key=plan.z_holidays). Each period celebrates or raises awareness for a specific disability or disability-related topic. As you read through the list, if you see something you don't know about, follow the link to learn more. Education starts with each of us.

## What can I do?

Read through the list and consider which awareness celebrations fit with your organization's mission or affect some of your friends, family or co-workers.

Consider how you can celebrate to raise awareness. Possibilities include:

- Create a social media post for that day.
- Add a banner to your website and link to an informative webpage (we've provided one for each day on the list). 
- Offer a discount for anyone who mentions the day at checkout.
- Post a sign in your facility with facts about the disability mentioned.
