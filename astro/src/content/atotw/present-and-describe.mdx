When learning to give presentations, one of the common pieces of advice is to "not read the slides". The rationale is that the audience can read the bullet points themselves; the speaker is not adding anything to the presentation by just dictating what is there.

However, that piece of advice makes an assumption: that the audience can read the slides. If some of your audience has a visual impairment or is only listening to the audio, they won't be able to read the slides. And any information that is only included on the slides will be lost.

In order to both engage your audience and provide accessible presentations, use your slides to present your key points. Keep the textual content short and the text size on the slides large to maximize readability.

For example, a slide for the ideas in this tip might say:
> **Goal:** Create accessible presentations
> 1. List the key points on the slides
> 2. Expand on each point while speaking
> 3. Provide captions and a transcript of recording

When you are speaking, talk to each point and expand upon it. This keeps your audience engaged because you are not just reading the slides. Describe any charts or images that appear in your presentation. By doing this, you make it easy to provide captions and audio descriptions to enhance your accessibility. Both the visual and auditory information will be included in the soundtrack.

If you record your presentation, you can automatically caption the file, clean up any errors and include the resulting transcript with the video. The transcript can also be used with the slides to generate printable handouts.

The end result is an engaging presentation that everyone can benefit from.
