Play is for adults as well as children. Activities, board games, and video games can all be accessible - or inaccessible. When planning something fun for a group that may include people with disabilities, plan ahead so that everyone can be included. If a group will be playing together, pick activities that can be adapted. If a group will split apart, provide accessible options so everyone can participate.

## What can I do?

Communicate ahead of time and ask your attendees what types of accommodations are needed. Be creative and have fun! For ideas, read the following resources.

### Activities

Select activities that can be modified for adults or kids with disabilities. The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK has <ExternalLink inline={true} href="https://www.nhs.uk/healthier-families/activities/accessible-activities/">recommendations for accessible activities</ExternalLink>.

Use an accessible location. Sites like <ExternalLink inline={true} href="https://www.nhs.uk/healthier-families/activities/accessible-activities/">AllTrails</ExternalLink> often include filters for wheelchair accessibility. Allow time to to orient your guests to the location. If hosting at a house, try to choose one with wide hallways and little to no stairs from the outside.
